            text: "Potters need a supply of clay to function. Some cities can produce their own clay by constructing @92Clay&Pits. Other cities may need to import clay from a trade partner (click @47here for more on trade). @PCartpushers bring supplies of clay to Potters from Clay Pits, if the city has them, or from @4Storage&Yards. The Potter stores some extra clay in its yard to keep him working for awhile if clay deliveries are interrupted for some reason. @PPotters also need road access and a nearby source of labor. Potters are at their most productive if they are fully staffed, but will still operate (although at reduced efficiency) when understaffed. If the Potter is turning out pottery, you will see him hard at work. Cartpushers employed by the Potter take finished pottery to a Storage Yard or to a @473Lamp&Maker (who needs a supply of pottery and oil to produce lamps). @PPottery is an important commodity in the city. @56Houses need a supply of pottery to evolve to higher levels, and pottery must be constantly replenished to prevent houses from devolving to lower levels. Demand for pottery never ceases: households are always replacing broken or worn-out pieces. See @2Bazaars for more on how to get finished goods to the citizens. @PPottery is also integral to the construction of @478Royal&Burial&Tombs. When a Lamp Maker fills pottery with oil, it becomes a powerful lamp that lights the way for tomb workers.  @PPottery can also be imported or exported. See @47trade for information on how to open trade routes. If your city is trading pottery, be sure to keep citizens' needs in mind. Let your @24Overseer&of&Commerce know how much pottery should be stored in Storage Yards for citizens' use, or let your Overseer determine an amount.  @PPeople don't want to live too near a noisy, dusty Potter, so it has a negative effect on the desirability of neighboring land. @L@LTo learn more about pottery making in ancient Egypt, click @198here."

            text: "Without Bazaars, people will never have access to the food and goods stored in the @3Granaries and @4Storage&Yards. Only Bazaars distribute needed supplies to the populace. @PTo function properly, Bazaars need road access and a full staff. The Bazaar will still function if it is understaffed, but at a much reduced efficiency. @PEach Bazaar employs two buyers, one to purchase food from Granaries, the other to purchase items from Storage Yards.  Each buyer is specialized: the Granary buyer cannot procure items from a Storage Yard, and vice versa.  Each of these buyers, however, can buy more than one item at a time.  So, for example, a Bazaar buyer that goes to the Granary can buy grain and pomegranates. She cannot, however, buy grain and pottery, because pottery is never stored in a Granary.  @POnce a Bazaar buyer finds the items she needs, a string of helpers carries the load back to the Bazaar. @PThe Bazaar buyer is a @42'destination&walker.' She spends her life shuttling between her Bazaar and the city's Granaries and Storage Yards.  Her job description exempts her from walking clear across the city to reach supplies, and she won't do business with more than three supply sources within her range.  If you catch her standing around when there's work to be done, you're probably expecting her to walk too far or deal with too many suppliers.  @PThe other Bazaar employee, the Bazaar trader, takes the items that buyers bring back and distributes them to nearby neighborhoods. As the trader passes within two spaces of housing, she supplies each house with whatever it needs if she has the items in stock. She also finds out what goods her customers want in order to improve their housing, and reports these needs to the buyer so she can get the necessary items. The first priority is to replenish the items a house needs to keep from devolving (see the @56housing&desirability entry). When those needs are satisfied, they try to get the next item the house needs to improve. @PThe Bazaar trader, then, is a 'roaming walker.' Her purpose is to wander through nearby blocks and serve her customers, rather than to proceed to some specific destination. If a particular housing section is not receiving goods, watch where the trader walks. She does not follow a set route. Every time she encounters an intersection, she chooses which way to go, and she won't always take the same path. Plan the city's roads carefully, and use @358Roadblocks to corral Bazaar traders. A Bazaar that has evolved to its more advanced state (shown by one of its tents being replaced by a small building) sends out two 'roaming walkers' instead of one.  @PPeople's needs for basic commodities, like food and pottery, must be met before more advanced wants, like beer or linen, are addressed. Bazaar buyers will ignore a Storage Yard brimming with linen if the houses they serve are crying out for pottery. It's very important, then, to maintain steady supplies of a commodity once houses start demanding it. Remember that as houses evolve, they usually hold more people and, so, consume more goods. Sometimes you'll have to add more Bazaars to keep a neighborhood properly stocked. Right-click on a house to see what its occupants need at any given moment.   @PTo help make sure that residents are getting the food and goods they need, build Granaries and Storage Yards near Bazaars.  Use the Granary's and Storage Yard's special orders to make sure they have the goods and foods that the Bazaars need. @PIf you want more control over a Bazaar, click on its 'Special Orders' button to see a list of all the commodities that it can stock. Click on an item to tell the Bazaar whether or not to buy it. @PWhile citizens need to live near Bazaars to have access to all the goods they desire, no one wants to live too close to them. They are noisy places, sometimes filled with unsavory characters, and can be smelly too.  @L@LTo get a feel for the sights, sounds and smells of an ancient Egyptian Bazaar, click @199here."

You can see what the Granary is storing by looking in its fill holes.  Right-click on a Granary to see precisely how much of each food it holds. @P@45Food&farms, @84Fishing&Wharves, @360Cattle&Ranches and @359Hunting&Lodges employ delivery men to bring their produce to Granaries. It's generally a good idea to have Granaries close to food producers. If a delivery man has to walk so far that his employer finishes producing another load of food before he returns with his empty cart, the production facility will sit idle until he comes to take away the food that has piled up there.   @PIf all Granaries are full, delivery men will wait around until some space in a Granary opens up, unless you have instructed a @4Storage&Yard to accept the particular food.   @PTo manage the flow of foods in the city, give Granaries Special Orders.  Right click on a Granary, then click the Special Orders button to get started.  All items the Granary can store are listed for you.  Click on an item to change the way that the specific Granary handles the food.  The choices are: @L@LAccept All/Fill Granary @LTo limit how much of a single food a Granary accepts, use the Fill command.  You can tell the Granary to Fill 1/4, 1/2 or 3/4 of the Granary.  If you do not want to limit the Granary's intake of a particular food, tell the Granary to Accept All of the item. This choice is useful when you want a Granary to store equal amounts of multiple food types.   @L@LDon't Accept  @LUse this command to tell a Granary to stop accepting a food altogether.  The Granary will not accept any new shipments of the particular food, but Bazaar buyers and cart pushers from other Granaries will continue to collect the item from the Granary until the stock is completely depleted. Use this option to make delivery men bypass a nearby Granary in favor of one farther away, or to prevent a food that you want to export from being consumed.   @L@LGet Up To @LIf a Granary is running low on a particular food that you want it to have on hand, use the Get Up To command.  The Granary's cart pusher will search for the item in other Granaries or in the city's Storage Yards until he has met the request.  You can tell a Granary to get up to 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 or the full capacity of the Granary. This option can enable Granaries far away from the city's food producers to remain stocked. @L@LEmpty Food   @LIf you issue this command, the Granary's cart pushers will try to empty the Granary's stock of food, looking for other Granaries or Storage Yards that have been told to accept the item. A Granary told to empty itself will not accept new shipments of the food that it is trying to send elsewhere. Use this order if you have decided to demolish a Granary, or if you want to remove one type of food that it carries. @L@LGranaries are dusty, often verminous, and not at all welcome neighbors. Citizens don't relish living near them. @L@LClick @5here to read about Granaries in ancient Egypt."

            text: "Storage Yards are the repository for all finished goods and excess raw materials.  They also store food if you specifically tell them to do so (see Special Orders, below) and help to trade imported and exported items (see the @47trade entry).   @PTo operate, Storage Yards need road access and a nearby supply of labor. Storage Yards are most efficient when they are fully staffed. They can operate if understaffed, but they might stop accepting particular commodities. @PEach Storage Yard is divided into eight sections and can store up to eight different items. Each section can accept only one type of item, but more than one section can store the same item.  The quantity of each item that can be stored depends upon the item's size.  The larger the item, the less of it a Storage Yard can store.  For example, one section of a Storage Yard can hold many more pieces of pottery than blocks of stone.   @PMany other buildings need easy access to the Storage Yards. @46Industry delivers products to the closest Storage Yard, and Bazaar buyers proceed to the nearest Storage Yard for goods their customers need. Storage Yards, in turn, will deliver raw materials and other needed supplies to the closest buildings first. Cart pushers from Storage Yards will grudgingly travel long distances if necessary, but industries could be idle while they are waiting for needed supplies. It's wise to locate Storage Yards near all the facilities that need them. @PRight-click on a Storage Yard to find out exactly how much of each item the particular Storage Yard has on hand and whether or not it can accept more goods.  If a Storage Yard can’t hold anymore of a particular item, the item is displayed in yellow. @PYou can control the influx and outflow of goods with Special Orders. When you click on the Special Orders button, a panel listing all the goods currently available to your city is displayed. Sometimes, you will have access to dozens of goods. Use the scroll buttons at the top of the screen to see more of the goods available. @PClick on an item to tell the Storage Yard how to handle it.  The orders are: @L@LAccept All/Fill   @LTo limit how much of a single item a Storage Yard accepts, use the Fill command.  You can tell the Storage Yard to Fill 1/4, 1/2 or 3/4 of the Storage Yard.  If you do not want to limit the Storage Yard's intake of a particular item, tell the Storage Yard to Accept All of the item.  This choice is useful when you want a Storage Yard to store equal amounts of multiple commodities, or if you want a yard to store food for export.   @L@LDon't Accept   @LUse this command to tell a Storage Yard to stop accepting an item altogether.  The Storage Yard will not accept any new shipments of the particular item, but Bazaar buyers, trade partners and industries in the city can use the supplies the Storage Yard still has on hand until the stock of the item is completely depleted.  Use this option to make delivery men bypass a nearby Storage Yard in favor of one farther away.  Unless you tell them otherwise, Storage Yards do not accept food, thus ensuring that food is delivered to Granaries instead.  @L@LGet Up To   @LIf a Storage Yard is running low on a particular item you would like it to have on hand, use the Get Up To command.  The Storage Yard's cart pusher will search for the item in other Storage Yards until he has met the request.  You can tell a Storage Yard to get up to 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 or the full capacity of the Storage Yard.  This option can enable outlying Storage Yards to remain stocked. @L@LEmpty   @LIf you issue this command, the Storage Yard's cart pusher will try to empty the Storage Yard's stock of the particular item, looking for industries or other Storage Yards that can accept the item.  Use this order if you have decided to demolish a yard, or if you want to remove one type of goods that it carries. @L@LStorage Yards are key to getting goods to the city's residents.  @2Bazaars get the goods citizens' need directly from Storage Yards. Storage Yards are also vital for trade. All imported goods are stored in the Storage Yards, and all goods earmarked for export are kept there until traders from other cities come to collect them. @L@LFind out about ancient Egyptian Storage Yards by clicking @6here."

            text: "Because farming was largely impossible during the Inundation, granaries were vitally important to ensure that the ancient Egyptians were fed year-round. Granaries not only stored grain and other foods, but also manufactured flour.  @L@LThe granary evolved over time. In the Archaic period, the Egyptian granary was shaped like a cone with a domed top. They were made from wood or brick, and the largest ones had ladders or steps leading to the filling hole. In the Middle Kingdom, the granary was shaped like a quadrangle and had a flat roof with several filling holes, like those depicted in our game. A third type of granary was used only for seed to be sown during the next growing season. These granaries were shaped like a trapezoid, a distinctly different shape than granaries used for food storage, so that the seed grain would not be eaten by mistake. @L@LMost granaries were strictly maintained by the government. Soldiers, construction workers and other non-agricultural workers all ate from these granaries. Some wealthy private citizens had their own granaries, and some peasants had their own small granaries to store whatever part of the harvest they were allowed to keep."

            text: "Peasants gather at Work Camps to be assigned to work on nearby @45floodplain&farms or on @370monuments. During the growing season, most peasants draw farming duty. During the Inundation, everyone works on the city's monument project.  If there's no monument being built, peasant workers have nothing to do but play a lot of senet during the Inundation.  If your city has few Work Camps relative to its number of floodplain farms, you will notice a distinct rhythm that's set by the Inundation. @PWork Camps need road access and their own staff. It is best to place Work Camps near farms and monuments so that the peasants don't have far to walk.  Indeed, there is a limit to how far they'll trek to reach their back-breaking chore.  The more Work Camps the city has, the quicker monuments can be built, because more laborers will be available during the growing season. @PThe number of farms one Work Camp can support depends mostly on proximity.  A fully-staffed Work Camp supplies one peasant worker every week (four per month).  This worker walks to the nearest floodplain farm that's awaiting a peasant, where he will toil for six months.   @PWhen a farm is halfway through its peasant's work period, Work Camp employees notice that the farm will need another peasant if farming is to continue without interruption - remember that the growing season lasts nine months in most regions.  If you're using one Work Camp to supply a very large number of farms, some might never receive peasants, and those that do will have trouble keeping peasant workers continuously. @PYou could run a huge number of floodplain farms with only one or two Work Camps, but many farms wouldn't reach their potential, and peasants would only be available to work on the monument during the Inundation.   @PPractically speaking, one Work Camp can support four to six nearby floodplain farms without interruption and still contribute some peasants to the city's monument project.  Adding more Work Camps spreads the burden around and frees up more peasants to work on the monument during the growing season. @L@LFor more on the working life in ancient Egypt, click @155here."

        content {
            text: "Money @PQ: I want my city to have money - and loads of it. What's the best way to build up the city's coffers? @PA: The simple answer to this question is to ensure the city earns more than it spends.  @PMake sure that nearly all of the city's residents are paying taxes. Raising the tax rate will add to the city's coffers, but the money may not be enough to offset the poor @39City&Sentiment that raising taxes can cause. Also, open @47trade relations as soon as possible, and export as much as you can (consult the @32World&Map to see how close the city is to its yearly trade limits).  @PReducing the amount that a city spends also helps profits. Build the city slowly and carefully. Buildings themselves cost money, of course, but you must also consider the money needed to pay employees and the cost involved in providing employees with housing and services. Building a city up too fast could easily result in debt due to the cost of wages and ancillary services. @L@PQ: Why can't my city collect taxes? @PA: Be sure that you have built a Palace. Cities cannot collect taxes until a Palace has been built. @L@PQ: I'm working as hard as I can, but I haven't been paid. What gives? @PA: A common lament, to be sure. In Pharaoh, you cannot draw a personal salary until you have built a Mansion. @L@PQ: How do I pay tribute?  What happens if I don't? @PA: Your treasury automatically pays tribute at the end of the year, assuming that you have money.  Just be sure that there's money in the vaults at the end of the year.  If your coffers are empty, you can't pay tribute, and your @35Kingdom&rating will drop.  If you're unable to pay tribute for a second consecutive year, your Kingdom rating falls a little more, and if your indebtedness continues beyond that, the penalty becomes more severe.  Read up on @48debt. @L@LWalkers @L@PQ: How come a building that says it has access to labor never finds any workers? @PA: You probably built a @358Roadblock too close to the building.  Watch the building for a moment to ensure that its walker pops out on the correct side of the Roadblock.  Sometimes the building's employees send their walker off in the wrong direction.  This can be particularly vexing with labor access seekers, because the building that employs them believes that it has access to labor, but the Roadblock prevents the walker from ever reaching the labor pool.  Rebuild the Roadblock a space farther away. @L@LReligion @PQ: I'd like to throw a festival, but I'm not allowed to. How come? @PA: There are a number of reasons you might not be able to throw a festival. Does your city have a Festival Square?  No square, no festivals.  Have you already held two festivals in the last 12 months? A city can only have two festivals in any 12-month period. If you are throwing a grand festival, be sure you have enough beer stored to hold the event. Finally, check the city's coffers. If the city can't pay for a festival, you can't throw one. @L@PQ: My city's patron god keeps getting mad at me. What do I have to do to appease this god? @PA: A city's patron god requires more attention than the local deities. Make sure you have more Temples and Shrines dedicated to him or her than you do to other gods in the city, and consider spending the money to build a Large Temple Complex in the patron god's honor. @L@LEntertainment @PQ: I can't find a viable location for my entertainment venue. What could the problem be? @PA: With the exception of Senet Houses, entertainment venues must be placed over an intersection, either a 'T' or a crossroads. Also, there must be clear space around the intersection to accomodate the venues' stages. @L@PQ: I have plenty of entertainment venues in the city, but no entertainers. Why aren't they putting on shows? @PA: Make sure you have Training Centers built in the city. Performers must first learn their crafts before they entertain the masses. @L@PQ: Why isn't my Senet House working? @PA: The answer is beer. Make sure the Senet House has beer on hand to serve to its patrons. @L@LFarming @PQ: Why aren't the floodplain farms producing crops? @PA: Check to see if there is a Work Camp near the farms. Peasants from a Work Camp till floodplain farm soil. @L@PQ:  How many floodplain farms can a Work Camp support? @PA:  It depends.  Read the Help entry on @8Work&Camps for a full explanation. @L@PQ: I've built a Fishing Wharf, but it doesn't have a boat. Why not? @PA: Fishing boats are built by a Shipwright. Make sure there is an active one in the city. @L@LStorage and Distribution @PQ: Bazaars keep running out of food and items. What can I do to keep their shelves stocked? @PA: Make sure you build a Granary and a Storage Yard near the Bazaar. If a Bazaar buyer has a long way to travel, her Bazaar is bound to run out of something while she's gone. Use the Granary and Storage Yard Special Orders to make sure these buildings are well stocked with supplies. @L@PQ: How can I use Storage Yards most effectively? @PA: To get the most out of @4Storage&Yards, carefully consider their placement in the city and make good use of their special orders. Storage Yards should be placed nearby buildings, such as Bazaars, Docks, monument construction sites and industries, that need their stored supplies. Use the Storage Yard special orders to make sure the goods stored are the ones that the nearby buildings need. Storage Yards should also be near industrial structures to reduce the time industry cart pushers spend in transit. If the cart pusher has a long way to travel to deliver his goods, his industry could idle in his absence.  @L@LMonuments @PQ:  What can I do to speed up the monument building process? @PA: Build plenty of Work Camps, the needed Construction Guilds and Storage Yards that accept only construction materials near the work site. If your city can produce its own construction materials, make sure you have lots of quarries and Brickworks to keep the Storage Yards full. Also be sure that the city has access to plenty of wood so that the Carpenters' Guild can build ramps and scaffolding. Import as much as you can from trade partners if your city cannot produce the necessary raw materials. If monument construction slows for any reason, consult the construction foreman by right-clicking on the construction site. He can tell you what is holding up construction. Also, if you have multiple construction sites in the city, peasants and construction workers may not agree on where to start, and so might not be working on any of them.  @L@PQ:  I need a particular resource to build my monument, but my city can't produce it and no one will sell it to me. Did the mission creators goof? @PA:  In some missions, the trade route that you need becomes available only when you satisfy other cities' requests (especially requests for military aid). If you fail the first request, you'll usually have opportunities to recover, and thereby to open the vital trade route. If you continue to fail these requests, you could lose the mission. Every mission does have all necessary commodities...but you sometimes have to work for them, and success is not always guaranteed.  @L@LTrade @PQ: I've opened a trade route, but my city isn't importing or exporting anything. How do I start the flow of trade? @PA: Visit your Overseer of Commerce and tell him which products to buy or sell. Also, make sure you have a Storage Yard in the city, and a Dock if your trade partner is coming by water. @L@PQ: I'm trying to import some food. I have a trade route open and have told the Overseer of Commerce to import it, but still no food comes.  People are getting hungry - what can I do? @L@PA: Make sure your Storage Yards have been told to accept the food you are trying to import. Remember, Storage Yards are told by default not to accept any food. L@PQ: I've let my @24Overseer&of&Commerce decide the level of traded goods to keep in the Storage Yards. How can I be sure that he is making good decisions? @PA: When you tell your Overseer of Commerce to manage trade, he looks at the size of the city's population, which industries the city has, and which monuments are currently under construction. Analyzing these factors only, he develops an assessment of your city's needs. To see what he recommends, click on his commodity control buttons. When the button that allows you to set the level appears, the amount shown as default is the amount the Overseer of Commerce recommends the city keep in its Storage Yards.  @L@LHousing @PQ: The housing areas I designate keep disappearing. What's happening? @PA: All housing must be within two spaces of a road. If it isn't it will disappear. Furthermore, migrants must be able to reach housing blocks. Make sure that you have a clear path between the points where migrants enter and leave the city (the @57Kingdom&Road) and your housing."

Choose which version of the city names you would like to use (either Classical or Egyptian) by selecting the Cities option.  You probably have a passing familiarity with the classical names, but the Egyptian option lends a bit more authenticity to Pharaoh. @PTo control the way you receive messages while playing, adjust the Popup Messages settings. Most of the messages you receive appear in a popup screen. When the screen pops up, the game stops until you close to screen. The Popup Messages settings allow you to turn this feature off for some of the messages you receive. From the category list provided, simply select which types of messages you do not want to receive as a popup message by clicking on the category name. The category name will appear in yellow, and messages in that category will be displayed in a banner across the top of the screen. They will also appear in your @34message&list. You will not have to stop governing the city to deal with the message. If you select 'Compliance Now Possible' from the list, requested goods will automatically be sent from the city's Storage Yards when the shipment is ready. See the entry on the @22Political&Overseer for more information on requests.  @PYou can turn the game's automatic save function on or off from this menu.  Autosave saves your game every six months, which gives you a reliable fallback if you forget to save manually or if you have computer problems.  It always overwrites the same filename, so there's no danger of filling up your hard drive with autosaves.  You might turn off this feature to eliminate the brief pauses while the game saves itself.   @PTo change the difficulty level at any time during the game, use the Difficulty option.  Note, however, that your mission score is tied to the difficulty level that you choose. If you change the difficulty part way through a mission, your score will be computed using the easiest level that you play. @PFinally, the Monument Speedup option allows you to use the gods' help in building some @370monuments. Turn the option on, and a god may choose to bless you by helping you build your monument. The gods enjoy working on certain monuments only, specifically the pyramids and mastabas."

With the Risks Overlays, housing and other buildings are still replaced by columns, but the taller and redder the column the greater the risk.  @PThe Problems Overlay shows the buildings that are not operating properly or that are about to develop a serious problem.  Icons indicating the problem appear on top of the building.  This overlay also shows cart pushers who have stalled because they have no place to bring their goods or food. @PWith the Desirability Overlay selected, the city's land is replaced by different colored blocks.  Gold blocks indicate the areas that people find the most desirable.  The browner the block, the less desirable the area. For more on desirability, click @56here. @PIf cliffs are blocking your view, use the Hide Cliffs Overlay to temporarily flatten them. If you have any Royal Burial Tombs built into the cliffs, you'll be able to see into them when you've selected the Hide Cliffs Overlay.  @PFinally, the Water Overlay is a little different from the other overlays as well. Access to water carriers is shown with blue columns that grow taller with better access.  This overlay also shows which land can support water-related structures and which land has access to drinking water from a well.  Dark blue squares mark the housing that has well water, and light blue squares show which land has the necessary groundwater to support a @62Well, @61Water&Supply or other building that needs groundwater access. @PThe best way to familiarize yourself with the different overlays is to experiment with them.

He knows how much of the requested good the city has available in its @4Storage&Yards and will notify you when you are able to comply with the request. You can then tell your Political Overseer to send the goods. It's generally a good idea to comply with requests from Pharaoh or other cities as quickly as possible. Ignoring a request entirely can reduce @47trade, or even prompt an attack on your city. Sending goods late is better than not sending them at all. @PThe Political Overseer also helps you manage your family savings. He knows how much you have saved and your current salary level. Family savings carry over from mission to mission unless Egypt's centralized government breaks down (between each Period). Your Political Overseer will change your salary if you so command. Simply click on the button that lists your current salary, and, when the list of titles with their associated salaries appears, choose a new salary level from this screen. Keep in mind that your fellow Egyptians frown on those who pay themselves more than their rank merits. @PIf you want to spend some of your family's savings, the Political Overseer will manage the transaction. You can choose to send a gift for Egypt (other political leaders or the people of other cities), or you can give to your city's treasury.  @PSending a gift for Egypt can boost your @35Kingdom&Rating.  If your family has enough saved, you can choose among three gifts to send. Don't be overly generous, though. If you send gifts too frequently, the recipients begin to expect them, and might grow angry if they stop arriving. They also tend to expect each gift to be more precious than the previous one. When you decide to send a gift, the Political Overseer will make sure the gift arrives intact. @PYou can also donate your family savings to the city's treasury.  This can be a good idea, especially if your family savings can prevent the city from going into debt. Debt can be a very expensive proposition. The Kingdom will loan your city money, but loans do come at a cost. For more on your city's money, click @48here. @PFinally, your Political Overseer knows your Kingdom rating and Egypt's general attitude towards you.

Visit him to turn city industries on or off, or to stockpile a particular good in the city's Storage Yards.  When a good is being stockpiled, it accumulates quickly in the Storage Yards because no one can use it.  It cannot be traded, and Bazaar buyers cannot procure the good for their customers.  If a raw material is being stockpiled, no shipments of the commodity will be delivered to its corresponding manufacturer.  You might want to stockpile some item against an anticipated future request for it, or you might stockpile a raw material before you actually build the industries that need it.   @PTo shut down an industry or stockpile a commodity, click on an item in the Overseer of Commerce's list.  Buttons with your different options appear in the panel that pops up. @PYour Overseer of Commerce also helps you establish the flow of trade.

Once you decide to trade an item, visit him and specify which items to trade by clicking on them.  You can tell him how much should be kept in the city's Storage Yards, or you can rely on his judgement and allow him to import and export food and goods as he sees fit.  The Overseer has been doing his job for a long time, and makes intelligent decisions about how much of each commodity your city should have on hand.  @PWhen importing, your Overseer continues to buy a good as long as the city has less than your chosen level (or, if using his own judgement, tries to buy just enough to maintain a small surplus in city storage).  When exporting, your Overseer sells goods any time the city has more than your chosen level.  Left to his own judgement, he evaluates whether your city needs each commodity for its own purposes, and refuses to sell more than the amount that he thinks you need to keep things running smoothly.  The Overseer is keenly attuned to the population's changing size, and he revises his decisions as the city's numbers fluctuate. @PThe entries on @46industry, @45food, and @47trade will help you understand the nuances of successful trade."

Although they don't contribute to the labor pool, scribes do pay a lot of tax money into your Palace vaults. @PBelow the graphs are several lines of very useful information. The first line tells you how many people your current level of food production can support and anticipated population trends based on current levels of immigration and emigration.

            text: "Ratings are a mark of how good the city is or how well you are doing as a leader. Four different ratings are used to measure the city: Culture, Prosperity, Kingdom and Monument. @L@LCulture @LThe Culture Rating assesses how much access your citizens have to @49entertainment, @50education, @53health and @51religion. The Culture rating measures not only the number of facilities you have, but also the variety of options. To achieve a high Culture rating, be sure to provide citizens with plenty of options. This means easy access to multiple forms of entertainment, health services (except Apothecaries - they have no effect on the Culture rating) and religion.   @PFor wealthier citizens, access to both Libraries and Scribal Schools is a must to keep the Culture rating on the rise, but access is not the entire story.  People learn better in quiet, uncrowded facilities, and your Culture rating reflects the quality of education by measuring how many people use each school and Library.  It's possible to have enough educational buildings to provide access for every house in the city, and yet still suffer from overcrowding. @PTo earn the highest Culture rating, see if you can build a @479Zoo. You'll need to build a Zoo if you need to attain a Culture rating higher than 75. Click on the Entertainment button to see if a Zoo is among your entertainment options.  @L@LProsperity @LThe Prosperity rating measures a city's wealth and its financial security.  The rating goes far beyond an assessment of the city's treasury: it also looks at the wealth of its citizens, taking into account the value of their property and the unemployment level.   @PIf the city earns a profit every year, its Prosperity rating should continue to rise if nothing else in the city is holding the rating back. High unemployment, low-level housing and low wages will stunt the rating's growth. Failure to pay tribute to the Kingdom will also decrease this rating. If a Temple Complex or Senet House is functioning in the city, its Prosperity rating rises, because people feel like the city is well-off if it has such glorious structures in it. Finishing a monument also gives the Prosperity rating a boost.  When the city ends the year in debt or loses money, the Prosperity rating suffers. However, if the city lost money because of construction costs, its Prosperity rating isn't affected, because expenditures on construction improve the city.    @L@LKingdom @LThe Kingdom rating represents your reputation, especially with the rest of Egypt. Quick response to an ally's request for help can increase the rating.  Failure to comply with requests, or missing an @48annual&tribute payment because of city debt, will hurt the Kingdom rating. If the Kingdom rating falls too low, your shoddy reputation might provoke an attack by Pharaoh or by a neighboring city. @PYou'll usually begin each mission with a rating of 50, which indicates neutrality.  People outside your city have barely even heard of you, and those who do know your name and history have few opinions about you.  Over time, if you do nothing to improve it, your Kingdom rating gradually falls as word goes out that you are of little importance beyond your city's borders.  The rating falls more dramatically if you lose or ignore distant battles, fail to comply with requests for goods or other demands from the rest of the Kingdom, and remain in @48debt for any length of time.  Drawing a salary beyond the standard for your rank doesn't help matters, either. @PYour Kingdom rating will also fall if @477tomb&robbers plunder @374burial&provisions from a tomb on your watch. Others in Egypt will think that you don't have proper respect for the dead.  @PTo raise your Kingdom rating, fulfill requests from Pharaoh or other Egyptian cities promptly, especially when they ask for military aid.  Victory in battle can do wonders for your reputation.  Sometimes even losing a battle might help a little bit, since you at least tried to rescue your countrymen in their hour of need. @PFor a quick pick-me-up in your reputation, use your family savings to buy a gift for Egypt.  Your Political Overseer sends the gift of your choice to Pharaoh, or to other Egyptian leaders, or to the people of Egypt - wherever he feels that it will do the most good.  Your Kingdom rating will rise by a few points immediately.  Resist the temptation to spend all of your savings on gifts, though.  They lose their effectiveness if they become too frequent, and the recipients will come to expect them.  Eventually, your rating might even decline if you stop sending gifts or send cheaper gifts than the recipients have grown to expect.  Exceeding one gift per year is of questionable effectiveness, and could even be counterproductive. @PApprehending a tomb robber is also appreciated by your fellow Egyptians, and your Kingdom rating will increase slightly for every tomb robber your constables catch. @PYour Kingdom rating's natural tendency to decline lessens a bit if you draw a personal salary below that defined for your rank.  Drawing no salary at all is even better for your reputation as a selfless public servant - although it isn't the best strategy for building up your family's wealth!     @L@LMonument @LThe Monument rating comes from both the size and scope of any monuments in the city, as well as how far along they are in construction.  If you complete all the monuments required and remember to dispatch any necessary burial provisions to provide for the deceased's afterlife, you will have no problem meeting the Monument Rating goal. @L@LA visit to your @23Ratings&Overseer will show you your current standing. When you click on a rating, your Ratings Overseer will advise you on how to improve it."

The presence of both these structures discourages potential criminals. @PIn spite of your best efforts, some portions of the city may produce criminals, especially residents of heavily industrialized areas.

These greedy citizens get together with their friends and speculate about the lavish burial provisions interred with the noble dead.

They march a little more slowly than infantry.  Archers craft their own bows and arrows, so you can build Archer Forts even if your city lacks a Weaponsmith. @L@LCharioteers @LThere is nothing more frightening to soldiers than seeing a line of chariots barreling towards them.

As the city becomes more established, it needs to provide more amenities to attract new immigrants and keep the inhabitants it has. The best way to keep residents from emigrating is to keep them in a good mood, resulting in high City Sentiment. @PThe key to keeping citizens in good humor is providing them with plenty of the basics: clean water, good food and jobs. Once these basics are covered, provide the services that enrich their lives.  Paying competitive wages and charging a reasonable tax rate also helps.  The city should continue to grow as long as you continue to provide plenty for citizens basic needs. @PFailure to meet citizens' needs can cause a wave of emigration.  Emigration can sometimes be the start of a vicious circle: emigrants leave because of lack of services, but in leaving they cause a worker shortage. This worker shortage causes even more services to suffer. You should avoid at all costs making conditions so bad in the city that people leave en masse. @PYour population can also grow and shrink as a result of births and deaths. Check in with your @25Overseer&of&the&Granaries often to monitor the average age of the city's population. Once workers reach a certain age, they retire, and a worker shortage could happen quite suddenly if a large portion of your population reaches retirement age. If you notice your populace aging, take steps to attract new immigrants, who are usually younger. @PIn addition to encouraging emigration, poor City Sentiment also encourages @36crime. @PIf you need a quick fix to poor City Sentiment, throw a lavish or grand @51festival. The festival distracts people from their troubles, and the merriment induces a pleasant feeling in citizens. Festivals are just a temporary solution, though. If you don't fix the underlying problems that created the poor City Sentiment in the first place, citizens' mood will again worsen. @L@LFor more on population growth in ancient Egypt, click @167here.

Others provide services to homes or other buildings that they pass. Still others are just arriving at or departing from your city. Only a very few elite people have the luxury of free time to walk about with no errand in mind. @PThese walkers can be divided into two basic types: destination walkers and roaming walkers.  Each behaves quite differently. @L@LDestination Walkers @LDestination walkers leave their places of employment with a specific goal in mind.  Using a map of your city's roads, they determine the shortest route to their destination. Examples of destination walkers include Bazaar buyers, emigrants, immigrants and delivery men. @L@LRoaming Walkers @LWalkers who roam the city bring benefits to your citizens when they pass within two spaces of housing.  Some also provide valuable services to the buildings in the city.   @PRoamers leave their buildings with no specific destination in mind.  They try to set off in a different direction every time.  From there, they can be completely unpredictable. @PEvery time walkers who roam the city encounter an intersection, they must decide which way to turn.  They don't make the same decision every time, so houses that they have passed before may not be visited again for some time.   @PThe best way to corral these walkers is through good city planning.  Since intersections give these walkers so much freedom, keeping intersections to a minimum helps to guide them to where you want them to go. @P@358Roadblocks are another effective tool in controlling roamers.  When a roamer encounters a Roadblock, he or she turns around.  Destination walkers ignore Roadblocks. @PExamples of roaming walkers include Bazaar sellers, water carriers, priests and physicians. @PSome roaming walkers behave like destination walkers under certain circumstances.  For example, fire marshals on their way to douse a fire or constables on their way to defend the city from some threat behave as destination walkers.  At all other times, though, they are roaming walkers. @L@LWalker Life @LRoaming walkers have a limited workday.  Their patrols last for a certain amount of time, after which they leave the streets for awhile.  If their employer has its full complement of workers, it sends another roamer out almost immediately.  If the building is short of employees, there is usually a delay in supplying a new roamer.   @PDestination walkers have to work until their errand is complete, even if that means walking all the way across town and back.   @PThose walkers who share both destination and roaming characteristics do have a limited workday.  Whatever time they must spend commuting to their destination reduces the amount of time that they can roam.  This is most noticable with performers, whose shows are cut short if they have long commutes from their schools to their stages. @PFinally, note that the embankment separating a flood plain from dry land is steep, muddy and treacherous.  No one can move to or from the flood plain unless a @57road makes this boundary passable. @L@LPredators @LNot everything that walks around the city is friendly. Dangerous animals also prowl the city and its environs, heartlessly killing anyone who might cross their paths. Constables will try their best to kill these beasts, but using your military is probably your best bet to defeat predators. Animals you should watch out for are hyenas, hippos, crocodiles, asps, scorpions and lions."

The city cannot provide for its citizens without a labor force. @PWhen you first construct a building that needs labor, a recruitment agent patrols the streets looking for willing workers. If he passes some housing nearby, and if the city overall has available workers, then his quest is successful and the building that sent him will have employees. @PThe labor seeker's job is not always easy. One of the greatest challenges as leader of a city is balancing the work force with the number of jobs available. In a perfect world, a city would have exactly the same number of jobs as people who want them. This hardly ever happens. A city will either have too many workers and not enough jobs, or too many jobs and not enough workers. @PUnemployment is not good for the city. While the unemployed workers are idle, they may become disenchanted and bring the @39sentiment of the city down. They could even turn to @36crime. The best way to deal with unemployment is to create new jobs. Generally, it doesn't hurt a city to have extra goods and services. A few extra farms, more entertainment facilities, and new Schools, Libraries or Temples can benefit the city. While reducing unemployment, you could increase the city's Prosperity and Culture ratings. @PAnother - albeit heartless - way to reduce unemployment is to reduce the city's population. You can do this by destroying people's homes, forcing emigration. This, too, can have a positive effect on the city. If you destroy lower level housing, the overall value of the city's housing stock will increase. This increase could result in a higher Prosperity rating. @PThe other employment problem you will face is the labor shortage, or having too many jobs for the available workforce. The ideal solution to a labor shortage is to attract new immigrants. Build new housing areas or encourage existing areas to evolve into larger structures. Make sure that @39City&Sentiment is high, too. Paying more than the prevailing wage in Egypt or lowering the city's tax rate can also attract new immigrants. @PWhile you are waiting for the influx of immigrants to take the available jobs, work with your @24Overseer&of&Commerce and @20Overseer&of&the&Workers to alleviate the shortage. Visit your Overseer of Commerce and shut down industries you can do without for a short time. This frees up some of your workforce to take other jobs. If you don't want to shut down an entire industry, you may need to demolish some of an industry's buildings.   @PTalk to your Overseer of the Workers about setting labor priorities. Making crucial jobs a top priority ensures that the citizens continue to receive what they need to live. @PAn unorthodox and not entirely good cure to a labor shortage is to encourage your @41scribes' homes to devolve back into @40workers' homes.  You'll damage the city's Prosperity rating and decrease its tax revenues, but the labor force will increase - at the cost of your wealthiest citizens' hopes and dreams! @PAlthough being out of work is quite stressful for the jobless, a small amount of unemployment is actually a good thing for an expanding city, because it gives you a willing labor pool for new buildings.  Unemployment in excess of 5 percent causes problems."

            text: "The way to citizens' hearts is through their stomachs.  Providing plenty of food - and a good variety - bolsters both @39City&Sentiment and @53City&Health.  @PThere are many types of food farms in Pharaoh, including @89grain, @90pomegranate, @90chickpea, @90lettuce and @90figs. There are also two types of farming in Pharaoh: floodplain farming and meadow farming. Both types of farms require road access and labor, but most similarities end there. Farming isn't the only source of food, either.  @359Hunting, @84fishing and @360cattle&ranching all contribute to the city's Granaries. @L@LFloodplain Farming @LTo understand how floodplain farms work, you must first understand the Nile's stages. Every year, usually between June and September, the Nile floods its banks. The flood plains are completely submerged, and nothing can be placed on the land. In a few months, the Nile begins to recede, leaving nutritious silt behind that fertilizes the soil. The flood plain reemerges, and you can again operate farms on the flood plain. @G56 @PThe Nile does not flood at exactly the same time or in exactly the same way every year. Some floods are better than others. Priests use Nilometers to determine how good the next flood will be and report their findings to your @31Chief&Overseer. Paying special attention to Osiris, God of Agriculture and the Nile Flood @51(see&Religion), can help ensure successful floods every year. @PYou can build farms (and roads, and Irrigation Ditches) on the flood plain at any time except during the flood. When you build a floodplain farm, only the field appears, with no buildings, because the flood destroys any buildings on the floodplain. Since they can't build homes on the floodplain farms, peasants need a place to meet to be assigned to work. @8Work&Camps serve this function.  Work Camps dispatch workers to the farms to plant and reap the crops, and farms lie idle unless there is a Work Camp.  There's a limit to how far peasants will walk to reach their back-breaking assignments, so don't put Work Camps too far from the fields. @PThe best time to build farms is soon after the flood recedes. You'll be able to take full advantage of the growing season until the next flood, and the farm will have maximum yield. Farms placed at any other time will produce less. @PThe other factor to consider when placing farms is fertility. The darker the land and lusher the grass, the more fertile the land is. The most fertile land is usually found directly adjacent to the river. As you move away from the river, the land becomes less fertile. Farms placed on the most fertile land produce the highest yields. You can build Irrigation Ditches on flood plains to irrigate the land farthest from the river, thereby improving the fertility of land which might be left high and dry during a poor Inundation. @PDue to the annual rhythm of the Nile, floodplain farms can produce only one crop each year. A city's survival can depend on having enough workers to harvest the crop, and enough storage space to accept the harvest. @L@LMeadow Farming @LFloodplain land is not the only fertile land, although it forms the bulk of available arable land. Farms can also be placed on meadows, denoted by yellow tufts. The denser these tufts are, the more fertile the land is, resulting in larger yields. These farms do have a work building on site, so they do not need peasants from a Work Camp. Because the land is not flooded, these farms continue to work throughout the year. However, acre for acre, meadow land is less fertile than floodplain land, and farms on the meadow tend to yield fewer crops per harvest.  Meadow farms almost always benefit from Irrigation Ditches. @L@LHunting and Fishing @LHunters and fishermen take advantage of Egypt's natural abundance. Both set out from their bases, capture their prey, and return back to their bases to prepare the food. @PHunters work out of Hunting Lodges. From the Lodge, they set out for the hunt. Hunters will look for flocks of ostriches, waterfowl, or a herd of antelope. If you notice any of these animals around the city, place a Hunting Lodge nearby. @PFishermen gather at Fishing Wharves where they swap stories about the one that got away. Wharves, of course, are located on the water, and fishermen need a Shipwright to build them a boat. Once they have a boat, they'll set out. Not every city can support hunting or fishing. If you notice fish jumping out of the water, the city can have a fishing industry.   @PHerd, flock and school sizes are limited.  Hunting and fishing can provide a small population with enough food, but a large population will not be able to subsist solely on fish or game meat. @L@LCattle Ranching @LCattle Ranches can be an excellent source of additional food. They can be placed on any type of land - not just fertile land - which saves arable land for another purpose.  Cattle consume straw, the by-product of @89grain&farming. The number of cattle ranches a city can have is limited only by the amount of straw the city can devote to cattle feed. @L@LFood Distribution @L@3Granaries and @2Bazaars are the intermediaries between food producers and the city's inhabitants. Granaries store the food intended for consumption by people, and Bazaars distribute it to individual homes.   @POnce a food producer has an item ready, a cartpusher brings the food to a Granary. Bazaar buyers go to the Granaries to procure the food their customers are asking for. They can carry more than one type of food at a time. After the buyers return to the Bazaar with their items, Bazaar traders walk through the neighborhood, delivering food to the populace. @PIt's important to have enough Granaries and Bazaars. If all Granaries are full, the cartpusher takes the food to a @4Storage&Yard, if it has been instructed to accept food. Bazaar buyers won't procure locally-produced food from Storage Yards (although they will take non-food items and imported foods there). Bazaar buyers get most food from Granaries. @PPlacing Bazaars and Granaries can be tricky. Granaries should be close to the food producers so that cartpushers don't have far to travel.  Bazaars should be close to Granaries so the Bazaar buyers can keep their Bazaars well-stocked.  Bazaars also need proximity to the houses they will serve.  All of these structures make for undesirable neighbors, so siting them always involves tradeoffs.   @PAs your city grows, you might have to build Granaries further away from the food producers to ensure that Bazaars in outlying neighborhoods can procure the food they need. If you find that you need to do this, use the Granary's Special Orders to make sure it receives food. @L@LImporting Food @LSome cities cannot produce enough food to sustain themselves, or can produce only limited varieties of food, and so need to import food from other cities. Imported food is delivered to Storage Yards, where Bazaar buyers can pick up the foodstuffs and bring it back to the Bazaar. @L@LRelated topics are hyperlinked throughout this section (hyperlinked words appear in a different color than the rest of the text).

Other products can be @47traded for a tidy profit.   @PWhile a city likely has a myriad of industries, all share certain characteristics. They all need a labor force, and efficiency is compromised if a particular manufacturer or raw material producer is understaffed. All industries need road access, too, so that workers can get to them. @PSome industries produce a raw material that can be processed into a finished good at a manufacturer. These industries are @92Clay&Pits, @361Gemstone&Mines, @93Copper&Mines, @94Wood&Cutters and @94Reed&Gatherers.  @91Barley&Farms, @91Henna&Farms and @91Flax&Farms also produce a raw material for industry. @89Grain&Farms, in addition to producing food, also produce a non-food item, straw. One raw material producer usually generates enough to support two finished goods industries. Raw materials can be traded, but they do not fetch as high a price as a finished product. @PIndustries that transform raw materials into another product (sometimes referred to as 'workshops') are @96Breweries, @99Jewelers, @60Weavers, @97Papyrus&Makers, @1Potters, @364Brickworks, @473Lamp&Makers, @470Paint&Makers, @98Weaponsmiths and @98Chariot&Makers. Their finished products can be used by the city or traded on the open market. @P@95Quarries and @93Gold&Mines are different from other industries, because their raw material is also their finished product. @82Shipwrights produce a finished product (ships) from a raw material (wood), but ships cannot be traded on the open market. @PDelivery men bring goods where they need to go. Delivery men employed by raw material producers always try first to bring their loads to workshops that needs the material, favoring the nearest location. If no industries require the raw material, the delivery man proceeds to the closest @4Storage&Yard that has room for his goods. If no Storage Yards are available, the delivery man takes a break until space opens up. The only raw material delivery men who do not behave in this fashion are the Gold Mine cart pusher and the quarry sled puller.  The Gold Mine cart pusher brings his gold only to the Palace, never to a Storage Yard.  Because stone cannot be manufactured into any other good, quarry sled pullers always bring their materials to a Storage Yard. @G74 @PSome city buildings need industrial goods to fully function. These include the @70Library, @68Scribal&School, @74Senet&House, @88Recruiter, @66Mortuary, @363Artisans'&Guild and @363Carpenters'&Guild. A delivery man from a manufacturer tries to bring his finished goods to one of these buildings that needs it. If none are available, he, too, brings his finished product to a Storage Yard, or stands idly by until space opens up. Cartpushers like these impromptu holidays, because they still draw wages and rations while standing about doing nothing.  @PTo see if your industries have any problems, use the @18Problems&Overlay.

Exporting goods brings in a lot of money - often more than the city can earn from taxes.

Cities willing to trade fly a flag.  Click on one of these cities to find out which products the municipality buys and sells.  Blue dots displayed in the corner of the commodity symbol show how much a city is willing to import or export each year.  One dot means they don't deal in that good very much at all, while three dots signal a strong desire to trade that item.  These levels can change with supply and demand or political pressures in Egypt.  @PClick on the 'Open Trade Route' button to spend the funds to establish the new partnership.  Opening a trade route can be costly, but it pays off in the long run. @POnce you open a trade route, visit your @24Overseer&of&Commerce to set up the interactions. Click the 'Show Prices' button to see how much products can be bought or sold for. You'll notice that products sell for less money than they cost you to buy. The difference in the prices covers the merchant's expenses in coming to your city. @L@LImporting @LTo import a good, click on the commodity you want. After you select an item, you have two choices.  You can decide for yourself how much of the item you would like the city to have on hand and instruct your Overseer of Commerce to behave accordingly.  Or, you can let your Overseer of Commerce decide how much the city should have on hand.  Your Overseer of Commerce will continue to import the item as long as the city's stocks are under the prescribed level, or until the trade partner's annual trade limit has been reached. @PSome goods your city needs can only be imported. These include white marble for monument construction and oil for @473lamps. To evolve the city's @56housing to its highest level, you will also have to import luxury goods. @PImports can become quite expensive, so monitor the city's @4Storage&Yards carefully. If you notice that the Storage Yards are full of a particular good the city is importing, save money by not importing the good until stocks are depleted. Also, importing raw materials is cheaper than importing finished products. In the long run, the city will save money if it has its own manufacturers to turn an imported raw material into a finished product. @L@LExporting @LTo export a good, click on the item you wish to export.  Then, decide for yourself how much the city should have on hand or let the Overseer of Commerce make the decision. Surpluses will be exported up to the customer's annual quota. Keep in mind that some commodities the city exports are also desired by its citizens, so make sure you keep enough in storage for citizens' needs. Check in with your Bazaars and your citizens' housing frequently to see if they have a supply of the good you are trading. Also, make sure that the buildings that need a finished good have a supply on hand. If housing and other buildings are having difficulty getting an item, the city is probably exporting too much. @L@LSometimes a city can either export or import the same commodity. This gives you more flexibility as you plan the city's industries. If you want to bolster a city's income, dedicate labor to produce the commodity and export it to a trade partner. If you want to use the city's labor force for another purpose, then import the product instead. The city can never simultaneously import and export an item, and it won't benefit from importing the product from one city just to sell it to another. Buyers pay more than sellers receive, so the city will only lose money if it acts as a middleman. On the other hand, importing a raw material and exporting its finished good is often a very profitable proposition. @PMerchants approach your city either by caravan or trade ship. Before you can trade with either type of merchant, you must have a working Storage Yard. In addition to a Storage Yard, you also need a @83Dock if you are to engage in trade with merchant barges. Trade ships conduct all their business at Docks, and when they arrive cartpushers from the Docks will retrieve needed items from the Storage Yards."

The city earns money by imposing taxes, exporting commodities, receiving gifts and, if available to the city, by mining gold.  These comparatively obvious topics are explained toward the end of this entry.  First, though, you should know the finer points of money management.  @L@LDebt @LThe first time your treasury runs dry, other Egyptian leaders might deliver a bail-out gift of additional debens.  This doesn't penalize you in any way, and they don't expect repayment.  Consider it a warning, though, that your city needs to change its free-spending ways. @PIf you spend all of your rescue funds, or if you don't receive such a gift, your treasury can accrue up to 5,000 debens in debt.  Yellow numbers show that your city has a debt. @PVery brief, sporadic forays into debt are often unavoidable, and these will not harm you if you quickly restore a positive balance to your accounts.  Long-term indebtedness can cost you the game. @L@LConsequences of Debt @LEvery month that your treasury has a deficit costs you an interest payment, which is automatically added to your debt total.  The greater your indebtedness, the more interest you have to pay, and the larger your debt grows.   @PWhenever your city ends a calendar year in debt, you cannot meet your annual tribute payment (see below).  Missing a tribute doesn't cost you any money, but it does depress your @35Kingdom&rating somewhat.  The effect worsens if you miss consecutive yearly tributes. @PIf you don't achieve a positive treasury balance (however briefly) for 12 months after first incurring debt, your Kingdom rating suffers as other Egyptian leaders lose confidence in your ability to govern.  Your first 'debt anniversary' penalty, while painful, probably won't cause irreparable harm.  If you have still not seen positive numbers on your second debt anniversary, your Kingdom rating drops substantially, and subsequent years will be even worse.   @L@LGetting Out of Debt @LDebt is clearly a serious problem, and when you can't avoid it, you need to retire your debt as quickly as possible.  Ways to raise money are discussed below, but you should also refrain from spending any of your limited credit on anything that will not ultimately earn you money.  Tax Collector's offices, industries that make exportable commodities and new trade routes with cities that will buy your products could all be wise expenditures.  @L@LAnnual Tribute @LAt the end of the year, your city has to pay a 'tax' to the Kingdom, known as 'tribute'.  The amount of tribute varies with your city's ability to pay, so that it starts out quite small and increases as the city grows in population and wealth.  Visit your @30Overseer&of&the&Treasury to see how much tribute you're paying.  @PAs long as you end a year with debens in your vaults, tribute payment is automatic.  You never actively make this payment.  Whenever you end the year in debt, though, your city can't pay its tribute, and your @35Kingdom&rating falls.  The penalty is not excessive for missing one year's tribute, but it grows larger the second consecutive year, and even larger after that.  This reflects your worsening reputation with your own people for being a poor financial manager.  @L@LTaxes @LTaxes charge citizens for all the services the city provides them. Citizens won't grumble about paying taxes as long as the tax rate is reasonable. The initial tax rate of 9 percent is a good benchmark, but you can raise or lower the rate at any time. Visit your Overseer of the Treasury or right-click on the Palace to adjust the rate. Lowering the tax rate buys you joy and appreciation. Raising the tax rate prompts complaints, and could lead to a mass exodus of citizens from the city. @PRaising the tax rate may be necessary sometimes. If you notice that your city is about to go into debt, you can raise the tax rate to alleviate the problem. You should probably find an alternate long-term solution to your city's money problems, though. A high tax rate can quickly worsen @39City&Sentiment. @PWhile citizens don't mind paying taxes, they won't volunteer a portion of their income without being asked. To collect taxes, the city must have a @77Palace. Then, build @80Tax&Collectors'&offices to actually collect the tax. @PThe Overseer of the Treasury knows what percentage of your population is registered for the tax, and how much tax income was not collected because of a lack of tax collectors. Use the @18Tax&Overlay to see if a particular area of your city is getting off easy. Also, make sure that you levy taxes in the city fairly.  If a portion of the city's inhabitants is paying a high tax rate and the other portion is not paying any at all, @39City&Sentiment will plunge, and @36crime could break out. @L@LTrade @LMoney from exports will likely be the city's main source of income. Open up trade routes as soon as possible. It's crucial that you understand how to export commodities, so be sure to read up on @47trade if this gives you problems. @L@LMining Gold @LSome cities can manufacture their own money. Gold is converted into debens, the basic currency in Egypt. If you see metal nuggets embedded in an outcropping of rock, then you might be able to build a @93Gold&Mine. Don't get too excited; the ore might turn out to be @93copper, which is quite valuable in its own right but usually not as welcome as gold. Click the industry button on the Control Panel, then click raw materials, to find out which precious metal your city can mine.  @PGold Mines function like other @46industries, but their output is delivered only to the Palace, where it is turned into debens, and never to a Storage Yard. @L@LFamily Savings and Salary @LLike the city, you, too, can earn money. You are paid for your efforts as city leader and can draw a wage as soon as you build yourself a @78Mansion. Your salary is paid to you from the city's treasury, and your wage is commensurate with your experience. You can choose to alter your wage, but if you pay yourself too much more than you are worth, your @35Kingdom&rating could tumble. You can also pay yourself less money, or not pay yourself at all, which can impress people and help your Kingdom rating. If your city is having financial difficulties, not paying yourself a salary is a good way to cut costs. @PYou can transfer family savings to the city treasury at any time - a good way to erase or prevent debt.  You can never transfer treasury money to your family account, though.  That would be embezzling! @PYour family savings can also purchase a 'gift for Egypt.'  Such donations to the people of Egypt, or, at your Overseer's discretion, to other Egyptian leaders will immediately improve your Kingdom rating by a small amount.  Be careful with this strategem, though.  Once the gifts begin, their recipients come to expect them, especially if you have been handing them out on a regular basis.  Cutting them off can actually harm your rating. @PReading the entry on the @22Political&Advisor will provide you with more information on your personal savings."

Some gods may be unknown to the city, and may be safely ignored. @PThe best way to appease the gods is to dedicate plenty of @67Temples&and&Shrines to them.

Each local god expects fewer Temples and Shrines than the patron god, but expects to have the same number of Shrines and Temples as the other local gods.  @PGods can also be appeased with festivals, the bigger the better. Lavish and grand festivals are valuable stop-gap measures if a particular god is growing angry with the city. Hold a festival in the angry god's honor, and the god will feel better, buying you time to erect more Temples or Shrines before incurring the god's wrath. Visit your @29Overseer&of&the&Temples to plan a festival. Note that until you have built a Festival Square, the city cannot hold a festival.

As time passes, however, citizens begin to expect the city to provide for their needs. As you meet these expectations, citizens take it upon themselves to improve their housing conditions.

Once a road is paved, you can place @79Plazas over it.  @PEfficiently planned roads can go a long way to ensure that your city runs smoothly. @42Walkers who provide services to your city move easier over long, straight roads rather than short roads with lots of twists, turns and intersections. @PNearly all structures in your city need access to roads. The only exceptions are Gardens, Statues, and Forts. Shrines, Walls and housing do not need direct road access, but must be within two spaces of the road to receive benefits from passing walkers. @PWalkers can only cross the boundary between the flood plain and dry land where there's a road.  This embankment is steep, muddy and treacherous, but a road permits safe passage. @PAll roads have the same traffic capacity, and walkers move at the same speed, regardless of whether or not they are paved. @L@LThe Kingdom Road @LThe road running through your lands when you begin a new mission is the Kingdom road, and it has a special status.  Trade caravans and immigrants arrive on the Kingdom road, and emigrants leave by it.  Every part of your city needs a clear path to the Kingdom road.  If you isolate some part of the city from this important thoroughfare, that area will stagnate.  Any delivery people who were en route to the now-isolated enclave will stop in their tracks until access is restored.  Sometimes royal architects might remove whatever structure you built that blocks access.   @PThis doesn't mean that every one of your city's streets has to physically connect to the Kingdom road, merely that all buildings must have a clear, walkable path, whether via road or empty land. @PChances are that this is all you need to know about the Kingdom road.  The finer points of building access will never concern most players, but there are some rare circumstances in which you might lose Kingdom road access without creating any visible obstruction. @PWhen you first build something new, the structure seeks a path to the Kingdom road, whether by your city's road network or by open, walkable land.  Most of the time, you place the building on an existing road, so that road's access to the Kingdom road is what matters.  Sometimes, though, you might build something that isn't on a road.  In these cases, the new structure checks for Kingdom road access across the intervening open land.  If you subsequently connect this building to a city street, the building redefines its access point to be on the new street.  So, if the new street itself cannot find a walkable path to the Kingdom road (perhaps it is blocked by the very building that you just connected it to), the building that adjoins this road will also lose access to the Kingdom road. @PFor more about 'access points,' read the following section. @POne final point about the Kingdom road:  There is nothing special about the actual, physical road itself - only the points at which it enters and leaves your lands are crucial.  You can relocate parts of the Kingdom road just like any other road in your city, as long as you do not block access to these vital entry and exit points. @L@LBuilding on Two Roads @LSometimes, you might place a building adjacent to two roads that are either unconnected to each other, or connected far from the building.  This does not let walkers leave or enter the building from both roads.  Every building can have only one 'access point,' and so only one active road. @PFor example, suppose that you build a Storage Yard with a road on its southern side.  Manufacturers, caravans and Bazaar buyers south of the Storage Yard will interact with it just as you would expect.  Now say that you want industries north of the yard to use it, too.  If you build a road on the northern side of the Storage Yard, you might expect that industries to the north will interact with the yard using the northern road, while industries to the south will continue to use the road to the south.  But the building can have only one access point, so those industries to the north are out of luck unless you build a connector between the northern and southern roads. @PWhen a building does have two or more roads adjacent to it, it chooses its access point based on the larger road network.  Using the example above, if the southern road is part of your city's main street network while the new northern road goes to a small industrial outpost, then the Storage Yard's 'access point' is on the southern road.  If, on the other hand, the original southern road leads to a smaller colony and the new northern road connects to the main city, then the northern road is the building's preferred access route. @PTo avoid unpredictable behavior, don't construct buildings that touch two unconnected roads.  Either connect the roads, or know that only one of them will actually carry traffic that can interact with the building.  Watch how walkers in the vicinity behave to determine which of the roads is the building's access point. @L@LClick @153here to travel the history of roads in ancient Egypt."

You can choose from a range of places on the other shore, provided the coastline is straight. Green blocks will highlight the appropriate places. @PBecause immigrants and emigrants use their own boats, they can use Ferry Landings as soon as they are placed. Ferry Landings must have workers, though, to transport other citizens. @42Walkers with a specific destination in mind, such as delivery men, Bazaar buyers, and entertainers walking to their venues, use the ferries. No other walkers are allowed on the ferries. @PTo transport immigrants, Ferry Landings do not need road access. Immigrants will cut across fields to get to the Ferry Landing. To transport other citizens, however, Ferry Landings do need road access. @L@LWith the @157Nile carving a path through the middle of their land, the ancient Egyptians employed all manners of boats to transport themselves and goods.

Note that the steep, muddy embankment between a flood plain and dry land is impassible except where a road connects the two terrains.   @PYou can issue a company the following orders:  @L@LHold Ground in Tight Formation @LIn tight formation, soldiers stand as close to each other as possible.  Because they have been told to hold ground, they will not leave their position to attack enemies.  They will attack any enemy that comes within their range, though.  The tight formation reduces the amount of ground that the soldiers can defend and makes them an easier target for enemy arrows.  Their shoulder-to-shoulder stance enhances their defensive strength in close combat.   @L@LHold Ground in Loose Formation  @LThis command can only be issued to infantry and archers; it cannot be issued to charioteers.  Soldiers in loose formation spread out to cover more ground while holding their positions.  They will attack if an enemy comes into range.  This formation makes infantry and archers less vulnerable to enemy arrows, but does not offer much protection against enemy infantry attack, as each soldier in the line can effectively only defend himself.   @L@LEngage Nearby Enemies @LWhen given this order, a company moves to attack enemies in their immediate vicinity.  The attack continues until the enemy is killed or retreats, or until you issue a different order...or until your own defeated company's morale breaks and your men head back to their Fort. @L@LMop-Up   @LWhen told to mop-up, soldiers seek out any enemies in a wide area and attack them.  Companies under mop-up orders are at their most aggressive, and they break formation entirely to fearlessly battle the foe.  Fearlessness, however, does hamper their ability to defend themselves, so this order is best used when the city's army outnumbers its enemies.   @L@LCharge  @LThe charge command can be issued only to charioteers.  Charging an enemy line breaks up its formation, making the enemy more vulnerable to attack.  When told to charge, the charioteers work the horses up into a lather, and they pull the chariots at top speed for a great distance.  Eventually, the horses tire and the chariots slow down and need to rest, so issue this order sparingly.   @L@LReturn to Fort   @LClick Return to Fort when your soldiers have done their duty and defeated the enemy.  At the Fort, they can rest up for the next battle.   If morale is low, they'll return to Fort on their own.  @L@LIn addition to issuing the specific orders outlined above, you can also tell companies to attack by selecting them and clicking on an enemy.

Wood and reeds gradually grow back, but both can be over-harvested. If you build too many Wood Cutters or Reed Gatherers, you run the risk of depleting the resource. Your harvesting industries will grind to a halt until the trees and reeds have a chance to grow back. @PWood is one of the most valuable commodities in Egypt.  Try not to destroy forests by clearing land - the city will be out a large source of income if you do.  Marshes cannot be cleared, and some healers associate them with malaria.   @L@LClick @192here to find out more about the importance of wood in ancient Egypt.  Click @188here to discover the many uses for reeds."

Some areas, though, have rock that's not of construction grade, or have too little rock to support industry.  In such areas, rock is just a nuisance, because it cannot be cleared, traversed or built upon.  Click on the Industrial Structures button and check the list of raw materials available.  This list shows you what types of stone, if any, can be quarried in the area. @PYou must build quarries adjacent to rocky outcroppings.  When you pick an appropriate location, you will see a green ghost of the quarry you're trying to place.  Otherwise, you will see a red block. @PStone cannot be manufactured into other products.  Stone is, however, the stuff of monuments, and significant amounts of stone are needed to complete even some of the smaller monuments. @PQuarries, which are dug into the side of rocky outcroppings, are prone to collapse.  Be sure to build an @81Architect's&post near the quarries to prevent disaster. @PQuarries need a staff of workers and road access to operate. Because of the noise from the constant banging on the rock, quarries are undesirable neighbors.  @L@LQuarrying in ancient Egypt was a very time-consuming task. To find out more, click @193here."

Abundant crops allowed Egypt to @177trade with neighbors, bringing new goods into Egypt. @L@LThe key to successful farming was the Inundation, called akhet. Every year, the Nile flooded its banks, refertilizing the soil. As long as the Inundation occurred, the Egyptians could count on having plenty of food to eat. In years of low or no Inundation, famine struck Egypt, which was sometimes enough to topple governments. @L@LTo take advantage of the restoring Inundation, dykes were built around farms to capture the water as it rose. As the Nile receded (called peret), the water, along with its nutrients, slowly soaked into the soil. After about six weeks, the farmer opened the dykes and let the rest of the water drain out. Of course, being submerged in water made the ground quite soft. Before he could sow his seed, the farmer had to wait for the land to dry out a little and become firm. @L@LFinally, during shemu, the crops were harvested. Crops meant for Egyptian consumption were stored in @5granaries. Food for export was stored in @6Storage&Yards until it could be loaded onto barges.  @L@LEstate owners or the government owned farms and employed laborers to do many of the most arduous tasks on the land. Farming was not easy work, and much of the work was done by hand. The tools farmers had at their disposal included the hoe, the hand-held plough, and the sickle. Domesticated oxen eased some of the plowing. @L@LFarming produced both raw materials and foodstuffs. @185Grain&and&barley were key food crops, and @189flax, which was manufactured into @398linen, was the most important raw material crop. @L@LFarming and agriculture were also integral to the Eygptian afterlife.

Egyptians began to build a network of irrigation canals and ditches as early as the ninth dynasty, or about 2000 BC. Some canals seem to have existed before then, but they were used for transportation. The irrigation canals extended the benefits of the river, bringing nourishing silt to areas away from the river. @L@LEarly in Egyptian history, farmers who wanted to irrigate their land had a tough time of it. Farmers irrigated their land by hand, carrying a yoke with two buckets made of clay or leather to the Nile or some other water source. The farmer returned with his buckets of water to his farm, which was subdivided by small dykes. The dykes captured the water, maximizing the benefit of this slow and arduous method of irrigation.  @L@LAt the end of the 18th dynasty (about 1300 BC), the water lift, or shaduf, was introduced. The shaduf probably came to Egypt from Mesopotamia, where it had been in use as early as 2370 BC. Positioned on the bank of the Nile or other water source, the shaduf was made from a long wooden beam that rocked back and forth on a pivot. A bucket at one end of the beam was counterbalanced with a brick or other weight. A person pushed down on the end with the bucket to dip it into the water, and the brick helped the worker lift the water into the gully that was attached to the shaduf. @L@LThe introduction of the shaduf increased the arable land in Egypt by about 15 percent. Also, because it was never submerged under water, land irrigated by the shaduf could produce two harvests a year instead of one."

Workers could also take time off if there was sickness or death in the family. @L@LAttendance was very well documented, as were the reasons for missing work. Some reasons for missing work probably wouldn't be acceptable excuses today. One employee missed work to go drinking with a buddy. @L@LDespite what many people think, slave labor was seldom used on state construction projects. Sometimes, slaves were used in quarries, but for the most part they served in households. @L@LIf workers were not treated well, they could go on strike.

They could afford the finest luxuries, including embalming, and often had fine tombs built. Their diets were richer and more varied than other Egyptians. In an examination of some mummified remains of upper class Egyptians, 10 to 20 percent had arteriosclerosis - hardening of the arteries - indicating the consumption of plenty of animal fat and, perhaps, a life of stress.

Some sources claim that Egyptian trade extended as far north as modern-day Turkey. @L@LThe Nile again played an important role in Egyptian trade. The river was navigable through the first cataract, or set of rocky waterfalls. It acted as a road and made travel to and from Nubia relatively easy. @L@LThe Nile also helped to provide one of Egypt's main exports: grain. The Inundation proved to be much more reliable than the rain in Lebanon and Syria. As long as the Inundation occurred, Egypt had a surplus of grain, a luxury Lebanon and Syria did not frequently have. Egypt's other exports included linen, papyrus, lentils, dried fish, gold and silver vessels, ox hides and rope. @L@LIn exchange, Egypt received a variety of goods as imports. Among the most important are gold from Nubia, wood from Lebanon and olive oil from Syria. The Egyptians also imported other luxury items, such as myrrh and wine, and livestock. The Egyptians also occasionally imported weapons. @L@LLaden with goods, caravans were especially prone to attack. For protection, armed units accompanied caravans on their trade missions. Because of these armed units, some historians speculate that Egypt did not engage in free trade with its neighbors, but rather bullied neighbors into giving up goods. While coercion probably played some role in Egyptian trade, some papyri also refer to negotiations between Egypt and its trade partners. @L@LSome successful trade missions were celebrated with inscriptions and artwork. Hatshepsut, a female pharaoh, sent a fleet of ships to Punt to procure myrrh, frankincense, ivory and other fine goods. The trip was deemed so successful that it is recorded on the walls of Hatshepsut's temple at Deir el-Bahri."

With the advent of pyramid building came the shipwright. Ships were important in transporting heavy materials needed for the construction of the pyramids. @L@LLike other industries in Egypt, shipwrights were government-owned operations. Equipped with woodworking tools, ship builders first made the hull of the boat by laying planks side by side and securing them with dowels, glue, and ropes designed to shrink when wet. When the ropes shrank, the hull was held fast. Hulls of larger boats were ribbed. Once the hull was complete, the shipwrights outfitted the rest of the boat, including a mast for the sail and holes for oars. Some of the larger ships had cabins. @L@LThe ships were broad-beamed and designed to ride very high on the surface of the water, which helped them stay afloat. The Nile, though relatively easy to navigate, did have its share of shoals and shallow points, and it was easy for ships to run aground. @L@LShipwrights built ships of significant size. One boat, used to transport obelisks to Hatshepsut's temple, measured 89 yards (82 meters) in length. One of the most famous archaeological finds is Khufu's barge. Found in about 1,224 pieces along the south side of Khufu's pyramid, the barge was reconstructed in the early 1960s. The boat is over 46 yards (42  meters long and 6.5 yards (6 meters) wide, with spots for 10 rowers plus an additional two that steered the boat. Historians are unsure of the significance of the boat. Some speculate that it is symbolic of Horus' sun ship. Others think that it may have been the barge that transported Khufu's remains to his pyramid, or that he used the boat during life. Regardless, the boat provides insight into the construction of Egyptian ships."

Egypt, though, was not always the one under attack. During the New Kingdom in particular, Egypt sought to expand its empire and invaded many neighboring lands. @L@LAmong the peoples Egypt waged war against are the Nubians and the Kush. Egypt invaded Nubia fairly early in its history (as early as 2900 BC), mostly to take advantage of Nubia's rich gold and copper resources. During the late period, however, Nubia gained the upper hand, and several Nubian pharaohs ruled Egypt. @L@LAcross the Sinai peninsula were several peoples with whom Egypt waged war. Among these are the Canaanites, Philistines, Bedouins (from what is now Syria) and the Hittites. The most notable of these Asiatic peoples, though, are the Hyksos. During the Second Intermediate Period, the Hyksos ruled Egypt. They retained many of Egypt's cultural practices, and introduced many innovations, such as the horse-drawn chariot. The Hyksos ruled Egypt for about 100 years until Ahmose I defeated them and assumed power. @L@LTo the west, Egypt engaged in war with Libyan tribes, particularly the Tehenu and Temehu. The Tehenu and Temehu attempted to move into the Egyptian Delta, and they were put down strongly by Sethos I. @182Forts were built in the west to help keep the tribes at bay.  @L@LFinally, the powerful Roman Empire reached the shores of Egypt during the rule of the Ptolemies.

During the New Kingdom's 18th dynasty, the punishment for stealing hides was 100 blows and five open wounds. Some particularly heinous crimes were punishable by cutting off the criminal's nose and banishing him or her to the outskirts of Egypt. @L@LEgyptian law was not strictly codified, and most punishments were meted out on a case-by-case basis. There are some lists of crimes and their punishments remaining, particularly from the New Kingdom, but these lists tend to be contradictory. @L@LJustice was an important concept in the afterlife as well. Before a person could enter the afterlife, he or she had to make a 'negative confession,' listing all the things the person hadn't done during his lifetime.

The men who served in the army came from different walks of life and presumably returned to their former professions as soon as the fighting was over. @L@LBy the time of the New Kingdom, however, the structure of the army had changed. The army was clearly divided into units of infantry and charioteers. The infantry could be divided into two parts: soldiers who specialized in close combat and those who specialized in longer range combat. Chariots were used for mobile long-range combat. Soldiers with bows and arrows rode each chariot, firing into the enemy. Naval combat was frequent, although the navy was not seen as a separate and distinct division of the armed forces. The navy was a part of the land forces, and soldiers who served on boats were described using the same terms as those that served on land. Again, foreigners comprised a significant portion of the army. Nubians, Libyans, Asiatics and Carians all fought on behalf of the Egyptians. @L@LThe Egyptian army was organized into battalions in the Old Kingdom. During the New Kingdom, the battalions were further subdivided into divisions, which were named after gods. Scribes and administrators would go to battle with the soldiers, presumably to keep track of the action. @L@LClick @196here to find out about the weapons the Egyptian army had at its disposal."

Wheat and barley were both turned into flour, then baked into bread. For more on the use of bread made from barley, see @194Beer. @L@LThe Egyptians used three types of wheat: emmer, einkorn and spelt. Wheat was processed into flour through threshing. Stalks of wheat were placed on the ground, and livestock or other large animals were brought in to stomp on the wheat. This pounding released the grain from the sheaves. Then, the grain was separated from the chaff and other impurities either by sifting or by throwing the wheat up in the air. The wind would carry off the lighter chaff, and the heavier wheat would fall to the ground. After the grain was processed, it was taken to the @5granaries. At the granaries, the wheat would be processed into flour and stored for future use.  @L@LTo make bread, a dough was made from flour and poured into ceramic molds of different shapes. The most popular shape was conical. The dough was baked in a hearth surrounded by hot coals and ash. Bread was baked both in the home and by professionals in bakeries. Archeologists speculate that because of the amount of ash in the air, professional bakers may not have been the healthiest people."

These cattle were tended by herdsmen, who were typically portrayed in tomb scenes as being very lean with unshaven faces. The cattle were sent to pasture to feed. Sometimes, the cattle were sent to fields that had been recently harvested to eat straw and chaff. @L@LThe Egyptians also raised sheep, goats and pigs on farms, as well as geese and other fowl. Horses were also raised, not for food, but to be used to draw the chariots of the noblest Egyptians. The horse was introduced into Egypt by the Hyksos, one of Egypt's @181invaders. @L@LFish provided an alternate source of food, though it seems to have been eaten primarily by the lower classes. The Egyptians caught fish in several different ways. Some set out in canoes and used fishing rods with lines and hooks to catch fish one at a time. Traps were also built to catch larger numbers of fish. The most efficient way to catch fish, however, was the drag net. Because the catch would be so great, bringing a drag net back to the surface required two boats of men. @L@LThere were dangers involved in the fishing profession. One species of catfish had a poisonous spine on its dorsal fin, and there was always the danger of crocodiles. Fishermen were safe enough in their boats, but should the boat capsize, the crocodile was seldom far behind."

This process was certainly very time consuming. Nevertheless, gold was relatively plentiful and was, in fact, easier to obtain than silver. @L@LTo prepare the gold for use, it was first melted down at the gold mines. Once melted, the gold was poured into water. As the gold cooled, it formed into nuggets, which were then taken to goldsmiths for use. @L@LLike almost every other commodity, gold inventory was strictly maintained by scribes. They carefully weighed out gold every morning to the smiths, and their work was carefully supervised to ensure that they weren't stealing any.  @L@LWhile gold was more plentiful than silver, by no means was there an excessive amount of gold available.

Each of these trees was accorded religious significance and viewed as a dwelling place for the gods. @L@LBecause of their special significance, wood cutters had to receive special permission before cutting trees down. The trees that were cut produced brittle wood that had limited uses. Egypt imported most of its wood from what is now Lebanon, Syria, and Israel. When Egypt eventually conquered these lands during the New Kingdom, they harvested trees with abandon, significantly depleting the tree stock. @L@LWood was used for furniture, coffins and in buildings.

Women were primarily responsible for brewing beer, and about 17 types of beer have been identified in papyri. @L@LThe Egyptians drank their beer out of specially designed mugs. The mugs were outfitted with an angled pipe, a little like a straw. At the end of the pipe was a filter, which sifted out any solid material that might be in the beer. In addition to drinking beer at home, Egyptians also drank beer in taverns and inns. For more on what went on in these neighborhood drinking establishments, click @172here."

Then, a second piece of cloth was placed on top, and the pith was beaten with a heavy piece of wood or a mallet. Beating the pith welded it together.

Pottery manufacture, one of the oldest industries in ancient Egypt, originated in the home, where women produced whatever vessels were needed for cooking. Like other industries in Egypt, pottery making moved from the milieu of the home to the workshop. @L@LThe first step to making pottery was preparing the @190clay for use. The clay had to be kneaded, and often straw or chaff was added to the clay to act as a binding agent. Men kneaded the clay by hand or by foot, stepping on it make the clay workable. The clay was then placed on a wheel to be shaped. @L@LThe potter's wheel evolved through time. In its earliest form, the potter turned the wheel with one hand while molding the clay with the other. Because the potter could not turn the wheel very fast, the pottery had to be smoothed by hand later. During the New Kingdom, a second person spun the wheel with both hands while the potter shaped the vessel. This led to a much smoother finished product. By the end of the New Kingdom, the potter was again spinning his own wheel, this time with his feet, which yielded the smoothest pottery yet. @L@LAfter the vessels were shaped, they were left to dry. The pieces were decorated during the drying process. After drying, they were fired in a kiln. The kiln was a large oven with a fire chamber at its base. The fire chamber was separated from an upper chamber by a clay grid. Pottery was placed on this grid. The top chamber was sealed except for a hole to let smoke out. Once firing was complete, the product was finished and stored until needed."

To aid them in their cause, it is hoped that you will endeavor to establish a thriving community at Perwadjyt, in the humid Delta region of Lower Egypt, thus spreading their influence throughout the length of the sacred river.  To support a population larger than that of a village, you must learn to use agriculture. @PEgyptian farmers have begun to exploit the rich, fertile soil deposited by the annual Inundation of the Nile river for growing crops.  The Nile can be hazardous, however.  Many dangers lurk along its banks and in its waters, such as deadly crocodiles, hippopotamuses and malaria-carrying mosquitoes."

Pharaoh Den has ordered a mining expedition into the unforgiving land of Sinai, beyond our borders and deep within Bedouin territory.  The area known as Timna is rich in gold and copper ore, as well as precious turquoise gemstones, but it is otherwise barren.  Conditions there will be harsh, and you'll need to import many amenities, perhaps even additional food and fine linen, from Egypt.  Pharaoh will demand frequent shipments from Sinai and will ask you for money, copper, gemstones and weapons.  You can use any surplus of these items to help support the expedition.  Be always on your guard, for the Bedouin of the Sinai desert are formidable adversaries, and they will not willingly allow foreigners to occupy their land, let alone plunder their mineral wealth. @PTo lighten the burden that such living conditions impose on your city's people, build a Pavilion at some busy intersection.

Pharaoh both curses and blesses your family, for though you have been awarded the status of Nomarch, you have also been charged with carrying out the most ambitious building project ever to be undertaken in our land.   @PPharaoh's eternal resting place shall be a massive pyramid complex, situated far from any city, on the plateau outside Rostja.  His sarcophagus shall be made of solid granite, and his funeral barge of precious Lebanese cedar. Beside Pharaoh's pyramid complex, a smaller pyramid shall also be built for his son prince Khafra, whose tyranny rivals that of his father, though his achievements do not.  Khafra also declares that his image be carved into the living rock at Rostja, upon a huge figure called a 'sphinx', with the body of a lion and the head of a man. @PTo support the massive building effort needed for the completion of this monument, you'll need to establish a large settlement at Rostja.  As such, conditions there may not be overly refined, for your goal is only to complete these three great projects, and to honor Pharaoh.   @PYou will be provided with some of the fine white limestone needed for the outer casing of these pyramids, but you will also need to purchase much of what you'll need with the city's own funds. @PPharaoh is entrusting you, one of his royal Nomarchs, with these three sacred tasks.  You must demonstrate unwavering dedication to Pharaoh and fulfill his wishes...whatever the cost."

We must stop their conquest before it is too late. @PHere at Sauty, we are safe from immediate attack, although the Hyksos have the gall to demand tribute. We may need to supply troops and arms to our compatriots in the north to help repel the Hyksos incursion.  They will look to you, O Mighty Pharaoh, for support.  But now we too have a new weapon.  Our wise military leaders have become proficient in the use of the dreaded chariot, and we shall turn it back upon our enemies and drive them before us. @PIf only our trouble was limited to the north!  Reports from our southern border show that the Nubians are once again taking advantage of a distracted Egypt.  They have reclaimed the southern cities of Iken and Heh. @PIf Egypt is to emerge intact from these turbulent times, much will be required of your generals in the field and on the river.  To inspire your two best generals, you have promised to build each of them a pyramid as spectacular as your own.  Holding your promise in their hearts, they are fiercely combating the foe, calling upon all their strength and sinew.   @PIf it pleases you, Mighty Pharaoh, you should build three magnificent pyramids at Sauty, one for yourself and one for each of your generals.  These three pyramids will take up considerable space, so you will need to surrender some valuable resources in order to accommodate them.  You may also need to extend your city across the Nile to avail yourself of all the resources needed for this city to flourish."

Sometimes the building's employees won't grasp your intentions, and they will send their walker off in the wrong direction.

Once you've designated a place for the building, peasants from the Work Camp clear the land and lay the foundation. @POnce the foundation is in place, stonemasons begin work.  Whenever a Storage Yard accumulates four blocks of sandstone, peasants load the stone on a sledge and drag it to the construction site.  Stonemasons put the stone in place until the first story is completed.  Then, carpenters install wooden ramps so that the stonemasons can work on the second story of the Mausoleum.  When the second story is complete, the Mausoleum is finished. @L@LRead about the history of these tombs by clicking @396here."

It is best to avoid such conflict altogether by ordering your city's monuments to be built sequentially, rather than simultaneously. @PBecause of their immense size, some monuments can be especially difficult to place in your city.

He, along with his wife and sister Isis and brother Seth, was one of the earliest gods and a member of the Eannead (see @399religion for more on the Eannead). @L@LThe myth that defines Osiris links him with agriculture, the Nile and funerary customs. Ra-Atum gave Osiris rule of ancient Egypt. Osiris married his sister, Isis, and taught the people many things as its ruler, most importantly the art of agriculture. After he schooled the Egyptians, Osiris left Egypt to civilize the rest of the world, leaving Isis in charge. Isis ruled well in his absence, but upon Osiris' return, his brother, Seth, began to plot against him. Seth invited Osiris to a sumptuous feast where he produced a beautiful coffin. He offered the coffin to whomever it best fit. When Osiris climbed in the coffin, Seth shut the lid and threw the coffin into the Nile. Isis managed to fish the coffin out of the Nile, but Seth caught her and hacked Osiris to pieces. Isis, distraught, cried, and her tears were believed to be the cause of the Inundation. Eventually, Isis gathered up the scattered pieces of Osiris' body except his genitalia, which had been consumed by the oxyrhynchus fish. Isis bandaged Osiris together with linen, much as mummies were bandaged. Egyptians were, understandably, banned from eating the oxyrhynchus fish. Eventually, Osiris became the god of the underworld and was the supreme judge who granted or denied entry into the afterlife. @L@LSebek, the crocodile god, was a fertility god who was worshipped primarily in the Fayuum, although he was known throughout Egypt. His name translates as 'watching over you.'  Min, god of regeneration, was also associated with male fertility and worshipped throughout Egypt."

Hunters used bows and arrows, lances, or spears to kill their quarry. @L@LThe Egyptians were equally fond of hunting water-based animals, including fowl and hippopotamus. Groups of men hunted the hippopotamus together with a special spear that was attached to a rope. Several men tried to hit the hippopotamus with the spears. Once enough damage had been inflicted, the men dragged the hippopotamus to shore using the rope. @L@LFowl were killed with throwing sticks, which are a little like Australian boomerangs. The hunter's helpers, either family members or servants, collected the felled fowl. Birds were also trapped in nets that were laid down on a field. The net was sprinkled with food for the birds.

Because ancient Egypt was a theocracy, priests frequently assumed administrative roles within their communities, sometimes dispensing justice. @L@LThe mark of a priest was his cleanliness. The priests underwent purification rites before they could enter the temple and shaved off their hair to ensure they did not harbor lice or other impurities. Depending on which god a priest served, he was prohibited from eating certain types of food. Priests had special clothing and were also required to wear white sandals. The highest ranking priests sometimes adorned themselves with leopard skins. @L@LThe primary religious concern for the priesthood was the care and feeding of the resident god. Each temple had a statue of its patron god on the premises. Each priest in the temple had his own responsibility to make sure the god was happy. Some of the priests were in charge of making sure the god was well fed. Using food that had been given as an offering by locals or produced on the temple's estate, the priests prepared a meal for the god. The god would partake of the 'essence' of the food, and the priests ate the leftovers. The priests also clothed and bathed the god and provided entertainment. Occasionally, the god would be taken on an outing and paraded through the village (see @393festivals for more). @L@LThe priesthood was divided into distinct classes. The most elite priest was the High Priest, also called the First Prophet, who was appointed by the pharaoh. The High Priest was the ultimate authority within the temple and frequently served as an advisor to the pharaoh. Beneath the High Priest were the Deputy High Priests, or Second Prophets, who oversaw particular functions of the temple or its estate, such as the workshops or the farms. Beneath them were the priests responsible for particular functions like bathing the god or providing entertainment. Most priests served in shifts, working one month out of every three."

The ancient Egyptians kept records of almost everything, and scribes were the only ones who could perform this function. Scribes recorded how much tax each person owed the government, kept track of exports and imports and even went to battle with soldiers to record events. For private citizens, scribes drew up legal documents, like wills, and also read and wrote letters for individuals. @L@LThe tools of the trade for the scribe included papyrus, a palette with two cakes of ink (typically black and red), a pot of water, and reed brushes. The scribe dipped the brush into the water and then rubbed the brush over a cake of ink. He then wrote on the papyrus. @L@LVery few scribes knew how to write hieroglyphics. Hieroglyphics were reserved for monuments and temples. For daily use, a simpler version of hieroglyphics, called hieratic, was used.  @L@LThe written language consisted of about 700 signs and combined symbols that represented sounds with symbols that represented ideas. The script omitted vowels, so historians can only speculate on how ancient Egyptian sounded."

It seems unfathomable that the ancient Egyptians, without the benefit of forklifts, cranes, backhoes and a slew of other modern equipment, could have constructed such magnificent structures. @L@LThe building of any pyramid started with a well laid-out plan. The vizier, second only to the pharaoh in rank, most likely oversaw the entire process with the royal architect (known as medjeh nesu in ancient Egyptian) specifying the plans. The royal architect was responsible for choosing material and figuring out how to get the material to the site. @L@LAfter the site was carefully chosen, astronomers determined the north-south axis of the pyramid. Then, surveyors laid out all sides of the pyramid using a special kind of cord that was so thick that it would not stretch and ruin the dimensions of the pyramid. Then, the ground was leveled, perhaps by filling ditches with water to determine a uniform plane. @L@LOnce these tasks were complete, construction was ready to begin. To kick off construction, a ceremony was held in which the pharaoh marked the corners of the pyramid with stakes, stretched a cord between the stakes, and placed a ceremonial mud brick as the first stone in the monument. @L@LAt this point, the @385stonemasons and @155laborers took over. Stonemasons carved out the underground rooms, including the burial chamber. Once these were ready, the arduous process of bringing stone blocks, some of which weighed as much as 2.5 tons, began. The stones were hauled on sleds, and ramps were probably used to reach the higher parts of the pyramid. In addition to the rough-hewn stones that made up the interior of the pyramid, finer stone encased the structure. @L@LSome pyramids stood alone, but more frequently they were part of larger pyramid complexes. The pyramid complex featured a valley temple that sat on the water or on the edge of the cultivated area. From the valley temple, a long causeway led to the mortuary temple, which was situated on the east side of the pyramid. @L@LThe form of pyramids evolved as the technology to build them was refined. The first pyramid, Djoser's Step Pyramid, does not have smooth sides. Built around 2620 BC, the Step Pyramid is a series of squares stacked on top of each other. The first true pyramid is Snofru's, built around 2550 BC. An outer casing smoothed the 'steps' of the pyramid, and this practice was soon adopted for other pyramids. The largest pyramid is Khufu's, which measures 252 x 252 yards (230 x 230 meters) and reaches heights of 160 yards (146 meters). One unique pyramid is Snofru's Bent Pyramid. The angle of the sides of the pyramid changes about two-thirds of the way to the top. The speculation is that architects determined that the pyramid would be too heavy and prone to collapse if it was continued at its original angle. And because Snofru's first pyramid collapsed, he probably thought he was better safe than sorry."

They celebrated for many different reasons: to honor a god, to mark the harvest and to recognize the longevity of the pharaoh. The last five days of the Egyptian year were spent celebrating, and numerous other festivals occurred throughout the year. @L@LIt was during festivals in honor of a deity that all people had direct access to their gods. At the center of religious festivals was the procession of the god. During the festival, the statue of the god that resided in the temple, beyond public view, was outfitted in its finest garments and paraded through town on a ceremonial bark borne by priests. The priests rested periodically, during which time rites were performed. During the New Kingdom, citizens could ask the god questions while the priests were resting. The priests bowed if the god responded positively to the question and moved back if the response was negative. At the end of the festival, the god returned to his home in the temple. @L@LSometimes, the gods travelled quite far and were transported by boat. For example, during the opet festival, Amun travelled from Karnak to his southern chapel at Luxor. To make the journey, he sailed along the Nile. Opet was one of the most joyous festivals and lasted anywhere from 11-27 days. @L@LIf a pharaoh was healthy enough to serve for 30 years, the heb-sed festival was held. Celebrated during the pharaoh's 30th year of rule and every three years thereafter, the festival featured the pharaoh performing a ritual run to prove he (or she) was still fit to rule. Some pharaohs didn't wait for 30 years to have a heb-sed and held them much earlier in their reigns. @L@LUndoubtedly, Egyptians from all walks of life welcomed festivals as a time to eat and drink very well. Festivals also offered respite from the daily grind."

Most cities, and even individuals, viewed a specific god as their patron, and this practice influenced which gods held the most importance. @L@LOne of the earliest belief structures was the Eannead, or group of nine gods. Founded in the city of On (Heliopolis), the first god in the Eannead is Atum, who linked with Ra to become Ra-Atum. Ra-Atum, though male, managed to give birth single handedly to twins, Shu and Tefnut. Shu was god of the air, and Tefnut was goddess of world order. Shu and Tefnut had four children: Isis, Osiris, Nephthys and Seth. Rounding out the nine gods is Horus, son of Isis and Osiris. Ra was eventually thought of separately from Atum and became the chief god of the Ennead. This system of gods dominated pre-Dynastic Egypt, and Ra continued to be an important god to the ancient Egyptians.  @L@LWhen Hor-Aha united Upper and Lower Egypt, his personal belief in Ptah, a creator god, changed the belief system. Hor-Aha maintained that the Eannead gods were all manifestations of Ptah. Still, Ra was the predominant god. @L@LAnother theory sprung from the Upper Egyptian city of Khmun (Hermopolis). The Hermopolitans believed in an Ogdoad, or group of eight gods. In the Ogdoad, a pair of male and female gods represent different aspects of the world. Nun and Naunent represented water, Huh and Hauhet represented unendingness, Kuk and Kauket were the darkness gods, and Amon and Amaunet were the air gods. @L@LIn the New Kingdom, Amon unseated Ra as the primary god. Amon's domination continued until the reign of Akhenaten. Akhenaten attempted to introduce monotheism into Egypt, maintaining that Aten, who was embodied by the sun's disk, was the only god. During his rule, known as the Armana period, Ahkenaten closed down the temples to other gods. Upon his death, however, polytheism was quickly reintroduced, and the temples to other gods were reopened."

To aid them in their cause, it is hoped that you will endeavor to establish a thriving community at Buto, in the humid Delta region of Lower Egypt, thus spreading their influence throughout the length of the sacred river.  To support a population larger than that of a village, you must learn to use agriculture. @PEgyptian farmers have begun to exploit the rich, fertile soil deposited by the annual inundation of the Nile river for growing crops.  The Nile can be hazardous, however.  Many dangers lurk along its banks and in its waters, such as deadly crocodiles, hippopotamuses and malaria-carrying mosquitoes."

Pharaoh Den has ordered a mining expedition into the unforgiving land of Sinai, beyond our borders and deep within Bedouin territory.  The area known as Timna is rich in gold and copper ore, as well as precious turquoise gemstones, but it is otherwise barren.  Conditions there will be harsh, and you'll need to import many amenities, perhaps even additional food and fine linen, from Egypt.  Pharaoh will demand frequent shipments from Sinai and will ask you for money, copper, gemstones and weapons.  You can use any surplus of these items to help support the expedition.  Be always on your guard, for the Bedouin of the Sinai desert are formidable adversaries, and they will not willingly allow foreigners to occupy their land, let alone plunder their mineral wealth. @PTo lighten the burden that such living conditions impose on your city's people, build a Pavilion at some busy intersection.

Khafra also declares that his image be carved into the living rock at Giza, upon a huge figure called a 'sphinx', with the body of a lion and the head of a man. @PTo support the massive building effort needed for the completion of this monument, you'll need to establish a large settlement at Giza.  As such, conditions there may not be overly refined, for your goal is only to complete these three great projects, and to honor Pharaoh.   @PYou will be provided with some of the fine white limestone needed for the outer casing of these pyramids, but you will also need to purchase much of what you'll need with the city's own funds. @PPharaoh is entrusting you, one of his royal Nomarchs, with these three sacred tasks.  You must demonstrate unwavering dedication to Pharaoh and fulfill his wishes...whatever the cost."

We may need to supply troops and arms to our compatriots in the north to help repel the Hyksos incursion.  They will look to you, O Mighty Pharaoh, for support.  But now we too have a new weapon, our wise military leaders have become proficient in the use of the dreaded chariot, and we shall turn it back upon our enemies and drive them before us. @PIf only our trouble was limited to the north!  Reports from our southern border show that the Nubians are once again taking advantage of a distracted Egypt.  They have reclaimed the southern cities of Mirgissa and Semna. @PIf Egypt is to emerge intact from these turbulent times, much will be required of your generals in the field and on the river.  To inspire your two best generals, you have promised to build each of them a pyramid as spectacular as your own.  Holding your promise in their hearts, they are fiercely combating the foe, calling upon all their strength and sinew.   @PIf it pleases you, Mighty Pharaoh, you should build three magnificent pyramids at Lykopolis, one for yourself and one for each of your generals.  These three pyramids will take up considerable space, so you will need to surrender some valuable resources in order to accommodate them.  You may also need to extend your city across the Nile to avail yourself of all the resources needed for this city to flourish."

Our clever leader is not easily outdone on the battlefield of wits, however.  If Caesar desires to use her as a means to further Rome's influence in Egypt, so too does she plan to employ him as an instrument of maintaining the dynastic power of our great land. @PCaesar's arrival in Alexandria with his unpopular Romans has sparked an uprising among its independent minded citizens.  An unruly mob, egged on by Cleopatra's younger brother Ptolemy XIII, has cornered Caesar and his men in the royal quarter of the city.  Bitter street fighting has erupted, claiming many casualties.  In a bid to keep his seaward escape route open, Caesar burned the Egyptian fleet as it lay at anchor in Alexandria's harbor.  Unfortunately the conflagration spread to some shoreline warehouses, burning great quantities of papyrus scrolls belonging to the Great Library.   @PTo break the trap in which he now finds himself, Caesar has summoned the loyal Mithradates and his troops from Syria to effect his rescue.

The lead elements of this force are currently encamped on the outskirts of the small village of Maritis, on the eastern shore of Lake Mariut, preparing for the final leg of their journey.  @PThe baleful Ptolemy XIII has learned of the approach of these reinforcements.  In response he has marched the bulk of his more numerous army southeastward out of Alexandria.  A decisive battle on the eastern shore of Lake Mariut is about to ensue.

To ensure that this journey is successful, Pharaoh wishes you to begin construction of his tomb at your earliest convenience.  Establish a village on the west bank of the Nile to provide a pool of capable workers.  Locate a suitable site for his tomb in the cliffs to the west of the village.  You will need skilled stonemasons to cut the tomb's many chambers from the rock, and talented artisans to plaster and paint the rooms.   @PTo provide light for the workers laboring in the far recesses of the tomb you will need to establish lamp maker shops.   Supply the lampmaker with pottery and imported oil for the fuel.  Plant fields of henna to provide a source of dye for brilliant colors the paint makers will need."

If Caesar desires to use her as a means to further Rome's influence in Egypt, so too does she plan to employ him as an instrument of maintaining the dynastic power of our great land. @PCaesar's arrival in Alexandria with his unpopular Romans has sparked an uprising among its independent minded citizens.

Establish a village on the west bank of the Nile to provide a pool of capable workers.  Locate a suitable site for his tomb in the cliffs to the west of the village.  You will need skilled stonemasons to cut the tomb's many chambers from the rock, and talented artisans to plaster and paint the rooms.   @PTo provide light for the workers laboring in the far recesses of the tomb you will need to establish lamp maker shops.   Supply the lampmaker with pottery and imported oil for the fuel.  Plant fields of henna to provide a source of dye for brilliant colors the paint makers will need."

These might then be mixed with a binding agent, such as plant gum or animal glue, and applied as paint. @PMany specialized artists worked together to create splendid bas-relief images in the tombs. First, plaster was prepared from a mixture of @190clay, water and a whitening agent and applied to the tomb's walls. Then, a rough design was traced in red onto the freshly plastered walls. A master draughtsman then refined this outline, usually in black. A master painter then made further corrections and added details to guide the bas-relief sculptor that followed him. Paint was then applied in large, flat colors. Final detailing, such as outlines and interior details, was then applied by another master artist."

Located on the western bank of the Nile across from the temple complex at Thebes, the Valley is overlooked by el-Qurn, an almost pyramid-shaped mountain that receives the last blessings of Ra each day before the sun sets.  Between the Valley and the great Nile are the royal mortuary temples inscribed to the pharaohs who expected to enjoy their afterlives in the Valley's tombs.  A nearby village, Deir el-Medina, housed hundreds of workers and their families. @PSpecialized workers prepared the Royal Burial Tombs, and each had an important task to carry out.  @385Masons chiseled steps and passageways into the limestone cliffs.  Stone pillars were left to hold up the roofs of large chambers.  The hewn rooms were smoothed and plastered before the @472artisans arrived to decorate the ceilings and walls with carved bas-reliefs and paintings that would help guide the pharaoh through his afterlife.  The deceased king was placed in his sarcophagus and sealed into the tomb with many treasures worthy of the deified status granted him by the ancient Egyptians.  Because of these great treasures, the tombs were frequently robbed, sometimes by the very people who were placed to guard them. @PEuropean archaeologists rediscovered the Valley of the Kings in the early 1800s.  In 1922 Howard Carter broke through the sealed tomb of Tutankhamun to find many treasures, including a golden sarcophagus.  Over the centuries, flash floods have filled many of the tombs with silt and debris, and it is a good bet that there are passageways - and maybe even some tombs - as yet undiscovered in the Valley."

If he meets a constable or some soldiers on his way to the tomb, he is usually quietly and effectively 'detained,' although an extremely agile thief can sometimes still escape.

As Egypt's power and influence spread across several continents, many pharaohs received strange and exotic creatures from rulers of distant lands as gifts or tribute. These animals were presented to the pharaoh, and were then kept in special zoological gardens, which would inevitably be found a short distance from the ruler's palace. Evidently, the early zoos of Egypt were primarily for public spectacle and secondarily for study. Alexandria's Great Library purportedly had both a botanical garden and a zoological yard on its grounds."

            text: "From its inception, Alexander the Great hoped that Alexandria, the city at the mouth of the Nile that he founded and helped plan, would become a center of trade and culture for the Mediterranean basin. Less than fifty years after its founding in 331 BC, the booming metropolis had become a sophisticated hub of commerce, due in large part to its famed Great Library.  @PSoon after Alexander's unexpectedly early death in 323 BC, his expansive empire dissolved into three major regions. One of his closest friends and ablest generals, Ptolemy, was at the time de facto governor of Egypt. He took control of the reins of that ancient land, eventually becoming pharaoh (as Ptolemy I Soter) and thus continuing the Greek presence in Egypt begun by Alexander. It was Ptolemy that intercepted Alexander's funerary procession, bound for Macedonia, and brought his mortal remains to Alexandria for internment.  @PBesides personal glory and luxurious living, however, the early Ptolemaic rulers were, to their credit, also interested in bettering the culture of their city and its land. Alexandria, Egypt's new capital, was already the center of commerce for the known world; they wanted it to become the intellectual capital as well. To this end Alexandria's Great Library was conceived and built. The Great Library was mankind's first center of scholastic learning and research. The brilliant minds of antiquity here laid the foundations for the systematic study of astronomy, geography, literature, mathematics, medicine, and physics. It was here that Euclid first defined geometry and Eratosthenes accurately measured the circumference of the earth, arguing that India could be reached by sailing westward from Spain. @PThe Ptolemy's devoted much time and energy, and not a small portion of their wealth, to obtaining copies of every important manuscript known to man. To this end a law was passed proclaiming that every caravan and ship entering Alexandria was to be searched - not for contraband, but for articles of learning. Any map or scroll found was turned in to the library so that scribes could copy it. Thus Alexandria's scholarly haven eventually contained over 700,000 systematically cataloged papyri scrolls, including many now-lost masterpieces of art, literature and science, such as classics by Homer, Aristotle, Sophocles, Aeschylus and Euripedes.  @PBut all was not letters of learning. The legendary library's grounds also boasted a botanical gardens and a museum, as well as a temple to the nine muses (Greek gods and goddesses of the arts and sciences). A short stroll along a garden-lined palisade would take one to a @480zoo no doubt containing many exotic animals. Many were the ancient scholars that walked its colonnaded passages.  @PWhat led to the Great Library's demise is not completely clear. A good portion of its priceless works was evidently destroyed in a fire that occurred when Julius Caesar torched the ships of Cleopatra VII's brother. By the fourth century AD, as Christianity's influence was spreading, most of the remaining manuscripts of the Library were apparently destroyed in an effort to stamp out all relics of paganism and heresy. Later, in 640 AD, Arabs that swept through the almost abandoned city probably burned for fuel whatever scrolls had survived. Of the 123 plays of Sophocles that were known to be in the Great Library, only seven remain today."

His suicide, followed shortly thereafter by Cleopatra's death, however, meant that this monument was completed by their rival, Octavian (Augustus Caesar), who completed the structure and dedicated it to his own cult. Two obelisks (commonly referred to as Cleopatra's Needles, even though she had nothing to do with them), for centuries were prominent landmarks along Alexandria's Eastern Harbor shoreline. These obelisks, transported to Alexandria from Heliopolis by order of Octavian, marked the entrance to Caesareum long after the rest of it was destroyed. Both of the obelisks have now been removed (one stands in New York City's Central Park, the other along the banks of the Thames in London). @PPrecise details about the actual structures of the Caesareum are not known. Our knowledge of it comes from brief descriptions by some ancient authors. Its architecture, like the other great monuments of Alexandria, was in the Greek style. It evidently contained a central sanctuary set amidst open-air courts and surrounded by stoas (columned walkways) that probably served as outer 'walls' for the monument. Rooms and porticos set amidst the stoas contained scrolls and could be used for assemblies or quiet study."

It was therefore conceived that a tall lighthouse on Pharos island, near the mouth of the harbor, would not only be of benefit to mariners, but (at least if magnificent enough) would also be a wondrous new attraction to boost Alexandria's renown.  @PThe Pharos lighthouse, as it came to be known, was partially constructed largely of Proconnesian white marble, much of it imported from Princes' Islands off the coast of present-day Turkey.  It was built in three large tiers:  the base, or lowest tier, was quadrangular; the middle tier was octagonal; the topmost tier was cylindrical.  A mammoth spiral stairway leading to the top even allowed pack animals to haul wood to the top to feed the bright fire that burned there.  Topping the spectacular structure was (by some accounts) a statue of Poseidon; another account contends it was an image of Zeus - or perhaps a statue of both of them. @PThe construction of Alexandria's Pharos lighthouse was begun by the first Ptolemy (Auletes), but wasn't finished until 283 BC during the reign of his son, Ptolemy Philadelphus.  By all accounts it was an incredible sight, more than worthy of being the Seventh Wonder of the ancient world. @PThis monument's ultimate demise was brought about not by the hand of man but by a series of earthquakes that rocked the region.  Its topmost tier tumbled down during a severe quake in 303 AD.  However it was not until a massive trembler on August 8th, 1303, that most of the remaining structure came down, to be swallowed up by the surrounding waters.  Today a fort, built by the Mamluk sultan Qait Bey, can be seen on Pharos Island where the wondrous lighthouse once stood."

This long-lived pharaoh is renowned for the many temples and monuments built during his reign, the grandest of which was Abu Simbel.   @PAbout 350 miles south of Waset (Thebes), in the province of Nubia, Ramses' stonemasons carved a row of four seated statues of the pharaoh in the pink sandstone cliffs overlooking the Nile valley.  Each statue is over 66 feet tall - only the Great Sphinx at Giza is taller.  The seated figures flank a tunnel entrance that leads to an inner sanctum dug 160 feet into the cliff.  The temple faces east and was designed so that twice a year light from the rising sun penetrates to the rear wall of the sanctum, illuminating three smaller statues of Ramses, Amun and Ra.  A statue of Ptah is also located in the sanctum, but because he is associated with the underworld, his statue is positioned so that sunlight does not fall upon it.  Reliefs inside the temple also commemorate Ramses' military victories.  Nearby, a sister temple carved into the cliffs honors the goddess Hathor and Ramses' foremost wife, Queen Nefertari.  The whole complex was intended to awe the Nubian subjects and encourage tributes from them.   @PAbu Simbel was completed ca. 1256 BC.  Over the millenia sands buried it.  In 1817 archaeologist Giovanni Belzoni uncovered the massive monument.  Threatened to be covered again in the mid 1960s, this time by waters rising behind the newly constructed Aswan High Dam, Abu Simbel was cut out of the cliff and reconstructed with great precision on higher ground - an engineering feat that would surely have impressed the ancient Egyptians."

According to the Book of Exodus in the Bible, the Lord God appeared to one of these children of Israel, the prophet Moses, and promised to help them escape to freedom.  Thus guided by the Lord, Moses appealed to the pharaoh to 'Let my people go,' on ten separate occasions, and Ramses denied the request each time. Each denial brought forth a different plague to afflict the pharaoh and the Egyptians while sparing the enslaved Hebrews.  First, the river turned to blood, killing the fish and making the water unfit to drink.  After Pharaoh's second denial, frogs came up from the ponds and rivers to infest the houses of the villages. The seventh plague was a thunderous hailstorm that smote men and beasts in the field and destroyed crops of barley and flax.  According to the Book of Exodus, Ramses' eighth denial to let the children of Israel leave Egypt brought forth a swarm of locusts, which darkened the land with their numbers and devoured all the green things that the hail of the previous plague had left. Ramses relented after the tenth plague killed all the first-born Egyptian children and beasts, though Ramses sent his army in pursuit of the fleeing Hebrews through the Sea of Reeds. @PThough these plagues are not recorded in contemporary Egyptian records, there are many instances of similar catastrophes occurring throughout history and prehistory.
